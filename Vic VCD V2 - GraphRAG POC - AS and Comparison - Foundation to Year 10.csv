Levels 7 and 8,"By the end of Level 8, students identify and describe how designers use visual communication practices to respond to briefs in different historical, social and cultural contexts. They apply this knowledge in the development of their own visual communication practices.
Students select and use appropriate drawing conventions, methods, materials, media, design elements and design principles to create effective visual communications.
Students evaluate how they and others are affected and influenced by visual communications from different cultures, times and places. They identify and describe practices of visual communication designers in visual communication from different cultures, times and places.","By the end of Level 8, students analyse how visual language and visual communication practices are used in visual communication designs they create and experience. They describe ways designers across cultures, times, places and other contexts communicate ideas and information in a range of contexts and fields of design practice, including the work of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples. They identify and describe the ethical, legal and cultural responsibilities of designers working across fields of design practice and apply these principles in their own design practice.
Students select and manipulate visual language, methods, media and materials when generating, developing and resolving design ideas, and refining concepts and solutions. They document and reflect on their design practice using design terminology. They produce visual communication design solutions by applying visual language and aspects of the visual communication design process. Students plan, present and discuss their own and/or others’ visual communication designs considering the communication need, context and audience or user.","Achievement standard has been reworded to align with the structural change of the VC2, and the key concepts in each strand. The structure of the Visual Communication Design VC2 is linked to learning in VCE Visual Communication Design"
Levels 9 and 10,"By the end of Level 10 students analyse and evaluate the visual communications they make and view, and how visual communications from different historical, social and cultural contexts communicate ideas and information.
Within visual communication fields, students develop briefs and visualise, generate and develop ideas in response to audience needs. They evaluate, reflect on, refine and justify their decisions and aesthetic choices.
Students demonstrate their use of visual communication design skills, techniques, conventions and processes in a range of design fields. They manipulate design elements and design principles, materials, methods, media and technologies to realise their concepts and ideas for specific purposes, audiences and needs.","By the end of Level 10, students analyse and evaluate how and why ideas and information are communicated in visual communication designs and solutions they design or experience. They evaluate the way designers across fields of design practice from different cultures, times, places and other contexts communicate ideas and information, including evaluating the practices of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander designers. They evaluate how designers celebrate and challenge perspectives of Australian identity in visual communications across fields of design practice and in different contexts.
Students select and apply visual language, methods, media and materials to generate design ideas, refine concepts and present solutions. They document, reflect on and annotate their own visual communication design practice. Students apply the visual communication design process to address a communication need and develop visual communication designs for target audiences and users. Students manipulate methods, media and materials and use visual language to produce visual communication designs to address a communication need for target audiences and users. They document and evaluate their use of the visual communication design process to present visual communication designs that address specific communication needs, audiences or users and different contexts.",Change in terminology to provide progression across the bands and to align with the structure of the strands. References to practices and visual communications by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples added for inclusivity. Terminology and progression provide a link to VCE Visual Arts and Visual Communication Design
