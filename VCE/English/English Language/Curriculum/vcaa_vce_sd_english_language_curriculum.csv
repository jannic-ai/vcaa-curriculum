In this unit, students consider the ways language is organised so that its users have the means to make sense of their experiences and to interact with others. Students explore the various functions of language and the nature of language as an elaborate system of signs and conventions. The relationship between speech and writing as the dominant language modes and the impact of situational and cultural contexts on language choices are also considered. Students investigate children's ability to acquire language and the stages of language acquisition across a range of subsystems.",,1
