It successfully identifies specific examples of language use, linking these to the broader purposes of the text. The response identifies and discusses specific linguistic features, linking them explicitly to their communicative effects and text functions. This demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of how language choices serve to achieve referential, conative and emotive functions. The response effectively integrates textual evidence with precise metalanguage. This showcases a high level of control over the terminology required for analysing texts in VCE English Language. Further, it consistently relates linguistic choices to the cultural and situational context of the text, particularly in highlighting the incorporation of Indigenous values and terminology to establish credibility and foster trust. This shows an appreciation of how texts reflect broader cultural and ideological underpinnings. The analysis of how the text maintains a moderately formal register that implies authority, solidarity and profundity is nuanced.

They employ the imperatives ""Join"" (54) and ""Read"" (65) when referring to webinars they offer and their impact statement. The unhedged nature of these order assists in engendering a didactic tone of command, galvanising audiences to take action and engage with the company further - bolstering the conative function.
RA employs hyperlinks of the noun phrases ""Narragunnawali...Plan"" (11) and ""professional learning"" (14) when referring to their programs. In addition to adhering to the expectations of the text type as a website article, thus bolstering the accessibility of the text and its coherence, such hyperlinks also assist in achieving the referential function by delineating where audiences can access further information to better apprise themselves on the programs that the company offers.
RA employs listing of the common nouns ""principal, teacher, parents, student or community member"" (38–39) when referring to demographics that the company is willing to support in their decision of choosing a program. By layering this common nouns, RA is able to achieve an all encompassing effect throughout this cohesive thread of nouns, ensuring that all demographics of their readers feel supported and guided through this process - something that bolsters the conative function of galvanising them to choose a program.
The function of the text shifts slightly in the spoken section, where RA bolsters their emotive function. RA employs the antithesis of the noun phrases ""some new, some old, some yet to be heard, some yet to be told"" (19) when referring to the multitude of Indigenous stories. By echoing these noun phrases in a cohesive thread, RA is able to highlight the juxtaposing nature of the contrasting adjectives ""new"" and ""old"" and the verbs ""heard"" and ""told"". As such, RA is able to construct a time continuum that catalogues the rich and profound history of the Indigenous community through their numerous traditions and stories, whilst also extending a hand to audiences to encourage them to continue bolstering this rich history through their own contribution. In turn, RA fosters sentiments of empowerment and agency among their audience to shape the future of the not only the Indigenous community, but the alliance between the First Nations people and the broader Australian community. As such, RA induces a paradigm shift towards rectifying injustices against Aboriginal members of their past where they have been shunned by wider society, and disseminates a clarion call to audiences to change this landscape and leave their legacy. By rousing such sentiments, RA achieves their emotive function, as well as their conative function of further compelling audiences to take part in programs that will enact this goal. In conjunction with the pauses “(...)” (19) after each of these noun phrases, RA further engenders a tone of profundity and solemnity, encouraging audiences to recognise the immense gravity of this task so they take it seriously. RA employs the adverb 'Together' (45) in conjunction with the first person pronoun 'we' in ""we're shaping..."" (45) when referring to the legacy that RA aims to leave by collaborating with audiences. The inclusive nature of these lexemes assists in rousing feelings of unity among the audience, as well as bolstering a sense of solidarity and equality with Indigenous people over this shared goal to shape the future legacy of Australia. Furthermore, RA evokes values of patriotism and collective pride for Australia by pandering to Australian values of egalitarianism and concordance, in a common desire to enact change – attending to their emotive function. As such, RA poses the audience as indivisible in their future goals, unifying both the broader Australian audience with Indigenous audiences – achieving their conative function.
RA shapes their discourse to reflect their cultural context. They employ the Indigenous borrowing ""Narragunnawali"" (68, 20, 8) throughout the text. As such, RA is able to establish a degree of credibility in their familiarity with the First Nations community, fostering trust among audiences that their programs are grounded culturally. Furthermore, through the explanation via the positively connoted abstract nouns ""alive, wellbeing"" (71) such language enables them to align their brand ethos with values of the Indigenous community, such as life and community.
Numerous stylistic features coalesce into a moderately formal register that is consistent throughout all modes of the text. RA employs the abstract noun phrases ""professional learning"" and ""curriculum resources"" (14) when referring to the programs they offer. The elevated nature of this lexis raises the formality of the discourse and assists RA in establishing a degree of expertise, experience and credibility as a company, fostering trust and reliance in audiences that their programs are backed by professional insights.",7

The introduction to this response explores the idea that language does not always define identity and that it can instead reflect identity and values, particularly in Australian society. In two of the body paragraphs, shown below, the response successfully explores these core points, with the first paragraph examining how language evolves to reflect social diversity and unity, highlighting its role in shaping and expressing contemporary Australian identities. The second extract of the response explores how linguistic resistance to change can reinforce rigid cultural norms, limiting inclusivity and the ability to adapt to a dynamic and multicultural society. The response as a whole successfully demonstrates the dynamic relationship between language and identity in contemporary Australia.",,,8

For instance, an increase in open gender diversity is evident in modern Australia, with the LGBTQ+ community becoming more comfortable in sharing that aspect of their identity. As such language is evolving to accommodate this, such as the 2023 Macquarie Dictionary word of the year shortlist “gendy nooch”. In order to reflect the identities of gender neutral people and simultaneously showcase their Australian identity, archetypal features such as the hypocoristic suffix “-y” and the shortening “nooch” from “neutral”, are employed. This meets the Australian goals of celebrating “our diversity” whilst “[striving] for a unified … nation” (Stimulus C). Hence, language is always shifting to be the best representation of a gender-diverse Australian identity, simultaneously.
…
However, due to the fact that language defines our Australian identity many become overly protective of preserving values preventing the constant change. For instance, in July 2024, an Australian swimming coach for the Olympics was denounced for supporting the Korean team and labelled as “un-Australian”. The use of the derivational prefix “un-“ indicates the existence of a set of hard rules as to what being an ‘Australian’ consists of, such as unwavering loyalty to the Australian swimming team. By prohibiting the support and encouragement to other international teams, the values of sportsmanship and mateship between nations is compromised. This implication of set rules as to what being an Australian consists of prevents necessary social, and consequently, linguistic change that more accurately defines the Australian community. The use of a term like “un-Australian” prevents growth and development in what defines an Australian, which is critical in promoting social harmony and inclusivity between cultures, like between Australians and Koreans.",9

This is clear through an article found under the “economics” section of the ABC News website in March 2024. The heading read “Tepid GDP extends Australia’s per capita recession”. This use of jargon, as illustrated through the initialism “GDP” and adjective “per capita” allow the ABC to effectively establish their expertise in the field of economics. Furthermore, they are able to successfully fulfil the referential function and build rapport with their audience, who also understand economics, and therefore the inference required to understand the jargon. This is ensured through the ABC’s clear understanding of context; because the article is on their website underneath “economics”, readers must actively go out of their way to locate this article, meaning only those who understand economics will read it. This can be held in contrast with the ABC’s use of language in a live TB broadcasted interview with Dr Karl Kruszelnicki regarding the “Aurora Australis” phenomenon of July 2024. Kruszelnicki describes the phenomenon as the sun having a “hissy fit”. The personification of the sun using this idiom demonstrates a starkly different register to that of the economics article, however, this choice effective builds rapport with the audience and fulfils the referential function regardless. Again, this is due to the understanding that viewers of this interview are everyday Australians, who do not necessarily have a scientific background. By explaining complex phenomena in relatable, colloquial terms, Kruszelnicki can build rapport with this specific audience. Therefore, context is the determining factor in whether language choices support purposes or not.
Politicians often show great variation in their language in order to build rapport with certain voting demographics, however, attitudes towards these politicians, as well as the broader context must be assessed for these to be successful. This is clear through leader of the Greens, Adam Bandt, who attempts to use “new slang words and slang phrases (to) earn at least grudging respect” (stimulus b). This is clear through a post on Instagram from August 2024, which reads “fishing for people, not corporations, very demure, very mindful”. The latter adjectival phrase is reflective of current Generation Z slang, allowing Bandt to exploit covert norms in order to successfully build rapport with this audience. Furthermore, this is assisted by his understanding of young people’s political frustrations and attitudes towards the current leading parties who seemingly don’t care about “the people”. Thus, by reflecting Generation Z’s language and reflecting their ideals, Bandt successfully builds rapport. This can be held in contrast with Anthony Albanese, who attempts to do something similar, however fails. In July 2024, he posted an image of a Spotify playlist with a title reading “high voltage power bill relief Thursday morning bangers”, which was an attempt to appeal to the covert norms of Generation Z by reflecting the humorous, incoherent syntax of algorithm generated Spotify playlists. This humour requires inference to understand, supposedly building rapport. However, he is ultimately unsuccessful, clear through a comment reading “no-one thinks you’re cool albo”. Instead of building rapport, he contradicts his purpose, making himself appear as an incompetent leader. This is ineffective due to the audience’s attitudes towards Albanese, who believe he is an incompetent leader, which is reinforced by the fact he is posting “silly memes” on Instagram instead of fixing problems as a PM should be.",15

They explored language used in public contexts, as well as language used in other language forms that are publicly viewed or received. Some responses considered social standing in the more micro sense, such as complying with covert norms when it’s expected, flouting overt norms; this was acceptable. Similarly, responses also considered the various levels of politeness used depending on context and how we can, deliberately or not, manipulate our register to assert or decrease power and authority and achieve various purposes. It was also relevant to consider the various attitudes towards the causes of these variations of language.",,,16

Politeness and register, while traditionally tied to asserting power and authority, have become more informal in Australia, with terms like ‘man’ and ‘bro’ replacing rigid honorifics. A number of students explored this shift through examples like Tasmania’s parliamentary change to ‘Honourable Speaker’ or the backlash to policing language too strictly. Additionally, some responses investigated how breaking politeness conventions, especially through covert norms, can bolster social standing, such as using humour to navigate taboo topics or anger in artistic and political expression to challenge societal norms.",,,17

Satire, parody and euphemism are used to negotiate taboo topics in politics, reportage and bureaucracy, where jargon signals authority but may threaten the audience’s negative face. Student responses explored how politicians like Senator Lidia Thorpe or Leader of the Opposition Peter Dutton gained or lost social standing depending on their linguistic choices, employing obfuscatory language or doublespeak to manipulate perceptions. Broader discussions also addressed how language is used to clarify or obscure meaning, exclude certain groups, or maintain authority in professions where clarity and expertise are critical, such as law or media, alongside issues of informality and misogyny in public discourse.",,,18

As part of this discussion, responses were required to consider how true it is that register and politeness go hand in hand with social standing. Not all responses did this. Higher-scoring responses argued that register is less important than effective politeness strategies, or that politeness strategies have a reduced importance in some contexts, such as when a register is highly informal or intimate and/or when complying with covert norms.",,,19

Whether it be through the success of euphemisms to ensure formality and the attendance to others' positive face needs to better bolster one's social standing, or through the overwhelming backlash towards individuals who do not adhere to such linguistic expectations such as through discriminatory language, there is an obvious need for awareness around one's register and politeness when addressing others. However, in some instances, even when one does employ a degree of circumspection around both of these factors, the fickle and unpredictable nature of language means that often users can end up with unwanted or unexpected outcomes. Ultimately, caution around one's register and politeness is vital to secure one's social standing in contemporary society, however, it should not be relied upon as a guaranteed indicator of success, given the fickleness of language.

Conversely, a lack of attention to one's register and politeness can be detrimental for the social standing of the user in society. Discriminatory language, such as that of racist and sexist rhetoric is such an example, resulting in immense criticism and backlash for its users. In 2024, three male students at Yarra Valley Grammar were suspended after compiling a highly offensive list rating the attractiveness of female peers, using the term 'unrapable'. Where a tone of respect and slight formality is expected around the taboo subject of rape and female equality, the non-Standard usage of the derivational prefix ""un"" lends an disturbingly relaxed and playful tone to the horrific mindset where women are objectified to mere tools of carnal pleasure for their male counterparts. Such informality serves to normalise the heinous crime of rape as a commonplace standard of consideration of female attractiveness, suggesting that women only exist in society for the pleasure of men and that their consent or autonomy is inconsequential. Such lack of reverence towards their female peers saw the boys receive immense backlash by their classmates and students countrywide on social media for such flagrant undermining of the role of women in society –something that diminished their social standing as previously popular and respected members of their cohort. Traversing beyond the playground, if such lack of adhere to basic politeness remains uncurbed, it intensifies and continues into society among adults, propagating similar prejudicial social attitudes. In 2024, a notable Australian doctor was banned from registering for another year as a GP after sending Indigenous ophthalmologist Rallah Baker a discriminatory email that read ""You are not full blood are you? Half? A quarter? One eight? Like a watered down bottle of Grange"". The pejorative vocatives ""Half? A quarter? One eight?"" engender a dehumanising tone by affronting Baker's positive face needs and qualifying his identity on the sole basis of genetic composition – a metric often used for animals. Likewise, the simile ""Like a watered down bottle of Grange"" takes on a belittling tone, minimising Baker's holistic identity to simply the colour of his skin. In turn, such racist rhetoric undermines Baker's professional prowess and invalidates his identity. Furthermore, it panders to and propagates stereotypical caricatures of Indigenous people where they are considered 'low-intellect' or inherently undeserving of their position in society. Such flagrant lack of respect towards the Indigenous identity of both Baker and other First Nations doctors, in conjunction with an absence of awareness around basic politeness, saw this previously acclaimed Australian doctor, blacklisted and shunned by colleagues, diminishing his once prestigious social standing. Ultimately, when politeness and register are not considered, in preference instead for expressing one's prejudicial attitudes, backlash and a decrease in social standing becomes inevitable.
[…]
Ultimately, one's formality and ability to adhere to politeness conventions have direct correlation with how one is perceived and their social standing, as seen when usage of euphemisms gains its user rapport with a certain demographic, and when usage of discriminatory language causes offense and decreases others respect towards the user. However, the fickle and unpredictable nature of language means that despite such awareness and caution around these factor, users can end up with unwanted or unexpected outcomes. Thus, although an important metric, register and politeness should not be relied upon as a guaranteed indicator for communicative success with all audiences.",24
