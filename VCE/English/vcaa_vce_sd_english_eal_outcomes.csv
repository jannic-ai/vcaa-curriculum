The study of texts at Years 7 to 10 may include examples of young adult fiction and non-fiction. However, in the senior levels, students will be expected to engage progressively with adult texts that reflect more complex concerns. Texts set for study at senior levels might include assumptions and attitudes that challenge or contest students’ understanding of the world, which will require teachers to develop reading and viewing strategies with their students to draw out possible meanings from the texts for deeper engagement and understanding. Students develop their own responses to these texts from personal engagement through to critical analysis, applying and refining their capacity for inferential reading and viewing as they grapple with many possible levels of meaning that can be extracted by a reader.",,1,43

However, the knowledge and skills will be applied to increasingly sophisticated texts at the senior level. The study of texts at Years 7 to 10 may include examples of young adult fiction and non-fiction. However, in the senior levels, students will be expected to engage progressively with adult texts that reflect more complex concerns. Texts set for study at senior levels might include assumptions and attitudes that challenge or contest students’ understanding of the world, which will require teachers to develop reading and viewing strategies with their students to draw out possible meanings from the texts for deeper engagement and understanding. Students develop their own responses to these texts from personal engagement through to critical analysis, applying and refining their capacity for inferential reading and viewing as they grapple with many possible levels of meaning that can be extracted by a reader.",,1,43
