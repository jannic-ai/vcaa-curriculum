English,English,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,VCEEU4AS2,VCEEEARC,VCEEEARCER,EnhancedStrategies,,Capacity to infer the intended listeners’ values and role in the text’s purpose,"Using an understanding of the text’s context, purpose and audience and the relationship between the speaker and listeners to create targeted analysis

This response demonstrated an understanding of context, audience and purpose in their introductions.","As council funding is verified and reallocated, the survival of ‘Our Local Gym’, a grassroots athletic establishment, has become an issue of extreme concern. Consequently, Sandy Gestalt, chair of the gym’s committee, delivered a speech to her fellow members, in which she claims the safety of Our Local Gym will be assured through her proposed partnership with confectionary brand Long Live Lollies. Addressing all members of the gym community, current and potential, Gestalt aspires to garner support for the presented partnership in the upcoming vote, in the hope that it will save Our Local Gym.",,2
English,English,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,VCEEU4AS2,VCEEEARC,VCEEEARCER,EnhancedStrategies,,Analysis of argument construction,"Focusing on the way in which ideas were strategically sequenced in order to position the listener given the text’s context and audience

This response used linguistic cues to indicate the argument’s strategy.","BP1 ‘Before she forwards her contention, Gestalt first seeks to imbue her speech with an overwhelmingly hopeful and optimistic tone.’ ‘… Gestalt not only strives to build rapport between audience and speaker given their long-standing connection, but also construct an optimistic future …’; ‘Gestalt guides her listeners to view the gym as a facility worth protecting, thus …’ 
BP2 ‘Having established the current predicament threatening the livelihood of such a special cultural institution, Gestalt continues by attempting to present a partnership with ‘Long Live Lollies’ as the only viable solution.’ 
BP3 ‘[She] implores the audience to … focus not on the immediate, ostensible challenges, but the opportunities also presented …’; ‘Thus, Gestalt guides her listeners to view her proposal of a partnership with enthusiasm …’ 
BP4 ‘By suggesting that each listener’s vote carries a responsibility to represent those not present as well …’; ‘also allows Gestalt to nonetheless convey the need to embrace what might seem “uncomfortable” … as an opportunity to grow …’",,3
English,English,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,VCEEU4AS2,VCEEEARC,VCEEEARCER,EnhancedStrategies,,Analysis of language,"Harnessing analytical thinking strategies and explaining how language was targeted at the views/values/beliefs of the intended audience

This response demonstrated clear and sustained use of the analytical thinking process.","Gestalt hopes to assure the concerns of fiscally conscious members of the gym community, who may struggle to cover the cost of an exorbitant membership fee, by evoking a sense of certainty through calling this declaration a ‘guarantee’.
… reminding [the listeners] that they are ‘not just voting for ourselves’. Evoking the transcendent nature of the community of Our Local Gym, Gestalt reminds her audience as such to reinvigorate with them both a sense of the gravity of their situation, and the importance of their decision. Gestalt hopes that by concluding in such a manner, she plays on the empathy held by those who cherish their gym community, and desires that they vote in support of her proposal not only for themselves, but for those like them, yet to discover Our Local Gym, who may foster an equally rich sense of community, provided the gym remains.",,4
English,English,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,VCEEU4AS2,VCEEEARC,VCEEEARCER,EnhancedStrategies,,Analysis of visual material,"Using the analytical thinking process on visual as well as written material

This response demonstrated a high level of skill when articulating an interpretation of the visual elements of the text and explaining why these could resonate with the intended audience.","After having established the importance of the gym and the risk of losing it, Gestalt logically puts forward her solution involving an affiliation with Long Live Lollies. Strategically commencing with an image depicting friendship and prosperity through sparkles and smiles on the cartoon’s faces, coupled with glistening eyes, disgruntled audiences are enlightened as to the positives …
In a final call to action, Gestalt compounds the notion of the ability of the community to ‘flourish’ with an affiliation with Long Live Lollies. Deliberately placing an image at the rear-end of her argument, Gestalt seeks to impress a positive outlook on lollies and fitness, within health-centred individuals. The image depicts a lady in a split, quite a flexible position, conveying health and strength. Along with a large lollipop at the focal point of the image. Gestalt encourages audiences to associate the duality of both her gym and Long Live Lollies to contribute to a healthy and joyful life as depicted in the lady’s smile.",,5
English,English,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,VCEEU4AS2,VCEEEARC,VCEEEARCER,EnhancedStrategies,,Capacity to explain interconnections between the text’s elements,"Indicating, by explaining the interplay between the elements of the text, how language and visual features amplify ideas and the role of this in positioning an audience

This response explained the way in which a persuasive idea was linguistically framed by the speaker’s vocabulary choices.","Additionally, the metaphor of Long Live Lollies as a ‘lifeline’ further compounds on the living and longevity of the gym that the committee prides themselves on, urging the audience to help the gym continue to provide for them in the same way a heart sustains a human body. Furthermore, while Gestalt does acknowledge the ‘serious clash’ that is presented, they present the need for money as for ‘community’ rather than ‘profit’, painting their company as one concerned with providing the best facilities for its members rather than obsessing over selfish monetary gain. Through this, the members are inspired to support the funding as it is not just an investment to the gym, but an investment into their future as well.",,6
English,English,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,VCEEU4AS2,VCEEEARC,VCEEEARCER,EnhancedStrategies,,Capacity to communicate ideas,"Using clear and appropriate language and sentence construction

This response exhibited a capacity to use language with precision to communicate ideas.",Gestalt places emphasis on the fact that this gym is a ‘safe space for all people’ including for the ‘young and young at heart’ in order to remind members of the gym about the inclusivity for each person. She portrays the facility in this altruistic light to encourage members to recognise how the gym facilitated the unification of the community …,,7
