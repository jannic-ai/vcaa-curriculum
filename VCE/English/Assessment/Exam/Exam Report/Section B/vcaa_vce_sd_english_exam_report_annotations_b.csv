One dash of black and we can turn all eyes to our canvas once we press record. With a final sprinkle of gold we swing. The media may try to vilify us as renegades instead of revolutionaries, who resist … but that’s because they’re scared. They are scared of accountability, so once we turn the cameras towards them, they can’t do anything but deny and blame. Now we’ll give them some context where they can’t deny and shift the blame. The government refused to listen to over 90% of the Royal Commission and thus the incarceration rates of the Indigenous are dangerously high. We will resist by lifting symbolic body bags across the streets. The government allowed mining giants like Rio Tinto to desecrate Indigenous heritage sites. We will resist by painting their colonial statues and then razing them to the ground. Now, they have to listen to our protests of a treaty. If not, we will become larger, stronger, and more calculated.

When you hear the name ‘Martin Luther King’ you may feel inspired, after all King was upfront about those who by stand racism as siding with the oppressors. His presidency empowered my community and his leadership in the civil rights movement, promoted a non-violent view of unity over divide. And you, during these rallies, whilst my community fought every day, just to be treated as equally human, just to topple the divide, you sat on your couch tuning into the next episode of ‘I Love, Lucy’. King’s death to us was symbolic of the need to resist and break the stereotype towards black individuals in America. His assassination by a white Conservative man shines a light on the deep rootedness of racism in our society, a series of dominos, that festers in the corners of our society. It proves that, despite our compassionate attempts and persistence, historically too, you have been ignorant of the divide, and silent, when your support was most needed.","The context of this text was established as being focused on the US, although there was one reference to Australia later. The audience appeared to be older white US citizens, judging from the reference to ‘I Love Lucy’. A dichotomy was created from the contrast between ‘my’ and ‘you’.

The American justice system preys on my people. They have eyes everywhere, likewise; the NYP utilizes excessive surveillance and patrolling in areas, concentrated with black people, an obvious blockade to the attempts at toppling, the divide. If there is more surveillance, naturally too there are more black arrests. Naturally, there are more black people with a criminal record, in for petty crimes and out as hardened criminals chained to a cycle of crime and discrimination. The American police system, simply diminishes any attempts at movements attempting to resist the racial injustice. Now every time you see black people gathering to defend the clearly racially, motivated, custody deaths, your mind wanders to the black kids on TV ransacking a random house down the street. And all of a sudden, the century long pleas and the push to tackle the dominance of racism is overshadowed by petty crime and media coverage that literally stem from discrimination and impoverished communities. The only way to address this, and … prejudice is through your persistence to accept and advocate about the broken system and its history. Crucially too, your views and comments of the black community as crime ridden, without considering the outstanding issue of socio-economic, divide have the potential to shift the perceptions of your children, encouraging day to day … limitation or rather a series of blockades and an army of resistance towards our attempts.","The text explored the need for resistance and the way in which persistence in protest is thwarted.

But at the same time it increases resistance towards the attempts of black individuals who voiced the need for integration and perpetuates the stereotypes you have towards my community. And yet we can’t persist or act through violent or aggressive means, especially since throughout history we have been labelled as hostile, criminal and dangerous. Despite the black lives matter movement, being a primarily peaceful form of resistance. After the killing of George Floyd, a small portion of the group turned to more violent means, including looting and arson. The burning of police buildings reflected the anger felt within the black community for the unjust death of Floyd at the hands of law enforcement. However, police brutality, America’s flawed persistence to view their behaviour as unruly extended to twist this act, even part of the violence, but rather normal people seeing justice. That movement held great irony, as we sought to topple the inherent discrimination in America and project Floyd’s last words, ‘I can’t breathe’, but we were met with chemical substances, leaving us too gasping for air, resisting for our lives, rather than against racial segregation. People were rightfully infuriated by this response, but the chaos in the violence only furthered the perception of my community, as belligerent, another blockade diminishing our attempts. For you, it may have been befitting that the law enforcement, essentially attacked both innocent and non-violent individuals of the movement, but for us, it was just another blow signifying the lack of understanding from white communities on the purpose of the Black Lives matter movement.","The protester’s dilemma was considered here.

Each win would light up my father’s face, but after every defeat, I felt the weight of his disappointment pressing harder, like the heavy hum of silence that follows a lost battle.

Because of this, I became locked in a bitter stalemate for the next six years, losing ground to opponents I once effortlessly surpassed.

An increased funding for play facilities and play spaces will not only encourage students to engage in physical play and in turn engage in physical activity, but it would enable students to release endorphins which promote feelings associated to joy, and in turn decrease the release of cortisol, our main stress hormone. In a study conducted by Beyond Blue it reported that 77% of students who engage in regular physical activity have decreased feelings of anxiety and stress. As youth mental health talk is becoming more common I believe it is just as important to install more of these facilities in high school settings.

As these play environments contribute to social skill it also builds on crucial skills like cooperation, problem-solving and confidence. These play facilities would prepare our students for the future world with these environments as a foundation for their social networking. Recent studies from the University of Melbourne have shown that schools that have these facilities reported 30% decrease in bullying. Bullying as we all know is negatively impacting students across all of Australia, so this may be an outlet to prevent bullying.
