The response considered the implications in the word ‘for’ and created a reading to explore this.","‘As indicated by the title, while much occurs in the play it is all for nothing.
Do you agree?’
More than merely a frivolous comedy of manners, Shakespeare’s Much Ado About Nothing unveils the strategies of subjugation and deception employed by a hereditary elite. Contrary to what the title might suggest, the play explores a range of confronting issues, including the moral depravity of a power-obsessed ruling class within a highly stratified society, the seemingly oppressive institution of marriage, and the construction of ostensible harmony in order to conceal human failings. However, despite the turmoil it experiences throughout the play, Messina’s social order is eventually returned to its original, underlying purpose: to perpetuate a values system that will inevitably be adopted by future generations. In this way, ‘nothing’ has occurred by the play’s conclusion.",2

This response used summary sentences in each paragraph to make explicit the ideas being presented and their connection to one another.","‘Tradition is inescapable.
To what extent does Chronicle of a Death Foretold show this to be true?’
BP1 Marquez exposes a social framework steeped in traditional notions of male conquest …
BP2 [These values are] extolled by an obstinate society who adhere unfailingly to their traditional social codes … [designed] to control, condone and rationalise the brutal upkeep of tradition to ensure its perpetuation …
BP3 The novel’s fragmentation thus illustrates how tradition itself is subject to decay and contortion under the town’s self-serving narratives.
BP4 [thus] … rendering tradition as only inescapable when a society does not reflect on their historical shortcomings.",3

This response considered the text’s linguistic elements, setting, characters and, by implication, the text’s structures and the way in which these elements interplayed to support the reading presented.","‘The Memory Police is as much about gain as it is about loss.
Discuss.’
… Ogawa posits that the complacency and passivity towards the loss of objects and memories within the island begins with the citizen’s desensitisation to loss, stifling their capacity to freely grieve or connect with one another for survival. The island’s isolation in ‘an expanse of a totally empty sea’ mirrors the pervasive solitude experienced by its inhabitants who are metaphorically adrift in a sea of forgotten memories, symbolising an inner ‘emptiness’ disconnecting them from one another. Capturing an emotional isolation in ‘eyes as still as a lonely swamp’, Ogawa continues her metaphor of an isolation … Within the gradual erasure of memories that permeates an emotional disconnection, Ogawa portrays the gradual erosion of humanity’s survival in the citizen’s amnesia resulting in … loss of knowledge in cultural identity and history … the blanket of ‘perfect and untouched’ snow not only represents the narrator’s reluctancy in rekindling ‘frightening’ memories, but also serves as a metaphor for society’s intensifying emotional numbness as an eternal winter falls on the island. … the suffocating imagery of ‘lay buried under the snow’ represents Japan’s tendency to ‘bur[y]’ its traumatic past … Ogawa demonstrates how placing responsibility of cultural amnesia on external forces is a projection of complacency … as citizens are unable to ‘discriminate’ between personal accountability and erosion of self awareness.",4

This response used the conclusion to resolve the topic and, thus, completed the response.","‘In Oedipus the King, all who deserve it are justly punished.
Do you agree?’
There is a sense that no human, no matter your accolades or past achievements, or even perception from others can succumb to their ego and lose touch with reality. Sophocles imparts to us that every being must understand their existential value in the world they find themselves in, and must be careful in attempting to take self willed action undermining the natural order, as you will find yourself measured and found wanting with just punishment. ‘Oedipus the King’ is not a play that demonstrates the atrocities, but rather the tragic enlightenment of the fundamentally ignorant …",5

The student used appropriate metalanguage and linking devices to explore complex interconnected ideas.","‘In High Ground a desire for control is the most important factor in decision-making. 
Do you agree?’
The film begins with the rising sun above Arnhem Land’s sacred rock structure, this scene is accompanied with the soundtrack of a Yolngu man chanting in his language. The song harmonises with the landscape as the camera slowly pans to reveal the vast Australian desert. Johnson promptly portrays the connection to land Indigenous Australians share. He furthers this notion by depicting a scene of young Gutjuk who is being taught a traditional dance by his uncle, Baywara. The dance is heavily inspired by the natural world, even their names derive from ‘Hawk’ & ‘Snake’. However, the serene harmony of this scene is interrupted by the sharp editing cuts to the marching colonial officers. Their faces are obscured & only their weapons are left visible, depicting them as ominous figures that are harbingers of chaos. 
Their actions are motivated by the desire to implement their ‘law’ … Unlike Indigenous communities that inhabit the land, they wish to own it … heinous atrocities that are committed … driven by this desire to control …",6
