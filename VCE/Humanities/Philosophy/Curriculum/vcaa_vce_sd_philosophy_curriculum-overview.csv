Humanities,Philosophy,Years 11 and 12,,VCEPH12OVSC01,Scope of study,,Paragraph,"VCE Philosophy contains a broad introduction to Western philosophy and its methods of inquiry. It explores themes and debates within metaphysics, epistemology and value theory, as well as techniques of reasoning and argument drawn from formal and informal logic. It investigates how we should live by examining what a good life is for the individual and the community, and what it means to believe well.",,1
Humanities,Philosophy,Years 11 and 12,,VCEPH12OVRA01,Rationale,,Paragraph,"Philosophy is broadly concerned with questions of ethics, epistemology and metaphysics. Philosophy is the founding discipline of logic, and it continues to develop and refine the tools of critical reasoning, influencing approaches in mathematics, digital coding, science and the humanities. Philosophers grapple with the problems that lie at the foundation of issues of public debate such as the concept of artificial intelligence, justification for a charter of human rights and freedom of speech.",,1
Humanities,Philosophy,Years 11 and 12,,VCEPH12OVRA02,Rationale,,Paragraph,"Philosophers are concerned with thinking rigorously and rationally about ideas, and exploring their meaning, context, coherence and implications. The nature of the questions studied, together with the techniques of reasoning and argument used to study them, can in turn help to create new ideas and insights.",,2
Humanities,Philosophy,Years 11 and 12,,VCEPH12OVRA03,Rationale,,Paragraph,"VCE Philosophy explores foundational ideas and enduring questions related to diverse fields including the humanities, sciences and the arts. It is a challenging study, which nurtures curiosity, problem-solving skills, open-mindedness and intellectual rigour.",,3
Humanities,Philosophy,Years 11 and 12,,VCEPH12OVRA04,Rationale,,Paragraph,"Studying VCE Philosophy involves explicitly developing the habits of clarifying concepts, analysing problems and constructing reasoned and coherent arguments.

Humanities,Philosophy,Years 11 and 12,,VCEPH12OVRA05,Rationale,,Paragraph,"Exploring big philosophical questions and the ideas of some of history's greatest thinkers promotes a satisfying intellectual life. The ability to think philosophically is highly regarded in careers that involve conceptual analysis, strategic thinking, insightful questioning and carefully reasoned arguments.",,5
