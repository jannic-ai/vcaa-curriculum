Humanities,Philosophy,Year 11,Unit 1,VCEPHU1AS12,,,,Paragraph,,"Unit 1: Philosophy, existence and knowledge","What is the nature of reality? How can we acquire certain knowledge? These are some of the questions that have challenged humans for millennia and underpin ongoing endeavours in areas as diverse as science, justice and the arts. This unit engages students with fundamental philosophical questions through active, guided investigation and critical discussion of 2 key areas of philosophy: epistemology and metaphysics. The emphasis is on philosophical inquiry - 'doing philosophy' - through the formulation and exploration of questions in philosophical exchanges with others. Hence the study and practice of techniques of philosophical reasoning are central to this unit. As students learn to think philosophically, appropriate examples of philosophical viewpoints and arguments, both contemporary and historical, are used to support, stimulate and enhance their thinking about central concepts and problems. At least one of these examples will be from a primary philosophical text using a complete text or an extract. As students investigate central concepts and problems, they will also consider the relationship between philosophical problems and relevant contemporary debates.",,1
