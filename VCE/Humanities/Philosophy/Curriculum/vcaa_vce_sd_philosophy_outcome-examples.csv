Humanities,Philosophy,Year 12,Unit 4,VCEPHU4AS1,Area of Study 1 - Foundations of belief,Outcome 1,VCEPHU4AS1O1KK,Activity,Bullet,"Examine the role of education in belief formation. Consider the function teachers play in helping students to learn how to justify their thinking and cement their beliefs. Reflect on the value of this process and the outcomes should such a process not be engaged by a society.

Humanities,Philosophy,Year 12,Unit 4,VCEPHU4AS1,Area of Study 1 - Foundations of belief,Outcome 1,VCEPHU4AS1O1KK,Activity,Bullet,"Consider sources we are likely to trust and evaluate the justification people might have for having this trust. For example, justification for trusting parents might be their perceived authority or history of nurturing.

Research historical examples where this process was successful and where it was not and consider the reason for the success or lack thereof as part of a reflection on the role these play in belief formation and defence. Use this as impetus for discussion surrounding the general question from the outcome of our responsibilities to others in relation to beliefs and belief formation as well as the obligations we may have when confronted by beliefs that disagree with our own.",,,,17

Also consider the opposite and compare the perceived success of these societies to reflect on the responsibilities we have to shape the beliefs of others. Consider researching historical examples of societies where beliefs are heavily legislated and compare these to societies that value free speech and expression highly as part of the reflection. Use this as impetus for further reflection and discussion on the general question from the outcome regarding the actions we ought to perform in light of encountering beliefs that disagree with our own.,,,,18

Humanities,Philosophy,Year 12,Unit 4,VCEPHU4AS1,Area of Study 1 - Foundations of belief,Outcome 1,VCEPHU4AS1O1KK,DetailedExampleStep,Bullet,Deeper level - We are inclined to trust educated people in our society. When we as individuals lack knowledge on something we feel less confident about it and so are inclined to defer to people who have knowledge in that area and trust it. This is a psychological justification for finding others credible that reveals a potential bias leading to flawed thinking. This is particularly prominent in areas of health and wellness as fear of one's own mortality leads to a desire to trust someone you believe may be able to help you survive. Clearly this is something that could be abused.,,,,30
Humanities,Philosophy,Year 12,Unit 4,VCEPHU4AS1,Area of Study 1 - Foundations of belief,Outcome 1,VCEPHU4AS1O1KK,DetailedExampleStep,Paragraph,"Finally, ask students to reflect on what issues with credibility their discussion has revealed. A group discussion of the sources of credibility that seem to exist as well as the flaws with them would be a useful concluding activity, followed by a self-reflection on each student's own susceptibility to accepting expertise and experience on face value without critical consideration.",,,,31

Humanities,Philosophy,Year 12,Unit 4,VCEPHU4AS1,Area of Study 1 - Foundations of belief,Outcome 1,VCEPHU4AS1O1KK,DetailedExampleStep,Bullet,Ask students to reflect on the ways teachers justify their teachings. What reasons do we have to trust what they say and do? Are there situations where a student should seek to challenge their teacher's teachings or try to disprove it? Or is it best to always trust their teaching?,,,,44
Humanities,Philosophy,Year 12,Unit 4,VCEPHU4AS1,Area of Study 1 - Foundations of belief,Outcome 1,VCEPHU4AS1O1KS,DetailedExampleStep,Bullet,"Finally, discuss as a group whether it is imperative for a society to educate its citizens and whether that education should be open and encourage self-development of systems of belief and justification or whether it should be rigid and regimented around specific tried and tested ways of thinking learning and believing. A class debate or reflective journal entry would be appropriate here, reflecting on how belief formation works in education and its value.",,,,45

Beginning with a reflection on when trust proved misplaced can help to narrow down when trust should be held. However, whenever dealing with students' personal experiences it is important to be careful and make sure students know they do not need to share their examples if they do not wish to. Alternatively, make it clear that they will be sharing and so should be careful about the examples they choose and how they censor them to protect identities.",,,,47

Humanities,Philosophy,Year 12,Unit 4,VCEPHU4AS1,Area of Study 1 - Foundations of belief,Outcome 1,VCEPHU4AS1O1KK,DetailedExampleStep,Bullet,"Ask students to reflect on a past experience where they trusted someone or something and this trust proved misplaced due to a negative outcome. This would be best run as a written exercise. For example: 'I heard on the news it was going to be a warm and sunny day today and it has turned very cold. However, trusting the news as I have been taught to think it is a reliable source of information, I wore summer uniform and don't have my jumper. I am now very cold and regretful.'",,,,49

Prior to this task it is recommended to engage in some setup.
