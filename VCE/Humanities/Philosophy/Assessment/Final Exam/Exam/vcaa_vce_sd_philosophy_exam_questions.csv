Humanities,Philosophy,,,Year 12,Final Exam,Exam Questions,2025,,VCEPH25ERA,VCEPH25EQA1,A,Section A,1,Q1,10,Question,"You want if possible - and there is no madder 'if possible' - to abolish suffering; and we? - it
really does seem that we would rather increase it and make it worse than it has ever been! Wellbeing
as you understand it - that is no goal, that seems to us an end! A state which soon renders man
ludicrous and contemptible - which makes it desirable that he should perish! The discipline of
suffering, of great suffering - do you not know that it is this discipline alone which has created every
elevation of mankind hitherto? That tension of the soul in misfortune which cultivates its strength,
its terror at the sight of great destruction, its inventiveness and bravery in undergoing, enduring,
interpreting, exploiting misfortune, and whatever of depth, mystery, mask, spirit, cunning and
greatness has been bestowed upon it - has it not been bestowed through suffering, through the
discipline of great suffering?

Humanities,Philosophy,,,Year 12,Final Exam,Exam Questions,2025,,VCEPH25ERA,VCEPH25EQA2,A,Section A,2,Q2,10,Question,"Distributive justice, the first type, organizes the allotment of public goods-honor, money, property.
It depends on a ""geometric"" or proportional notion of equality. For instance, two people get an equal
amount to eat for dinner when each is served a portion in proportion to his appetite. Although one
diner may get a larger serving than another, each will have been treated equally provided that in
each case the serving matches the appetite. Every type of regime has its own principle of desert for
deciding how to make proportional distributions: aristocracies, for instance, assign greater benefits
to nobly born citizens. Aristotle advocates instead an approach in which people receive benefits
from the public store equivalent to what they have given to it, and he consistently argues, for
instance, that the rich should contribute proportionally more wealth to the public store and receive
proportionally more honor in return. Honor is the good that the poor have to give.

Humanities,Philosophy,,,Year 12,Final Exam,Exam Questions,2025,,VCEPH25ERA,VCEPH25EQA3,A,Section A,3,Q3,10,Question,"The following extract is from an interview with Violet CoCo by The Philosophy Club. CoCo is an
environmental activist and a member of Extinction Rebellion, a global movement that agitates for
government action on climate change. The group organises acts of nonviolent civil disobedience
a form of protest where laws or the instructions of authorities are deliberately disobeyed - to draw
attention to social issues. CoCo has been arrested several times because of her protests.
[...]
Violet CoCo: ... part of what drives me is the very feeling of insecurity, of worrying about my own
and others' safety ... My focus is on the climate and ecological emergency: the most daunting
problems that confront our society, our biosphere, and our planet. We now face an existential threat.
The sixth mass extinction is underway, and threatens to extinguish 98% of life on earth. Human
behaviour is responsible for this.
The Philosophy Club: Could you tell our readers about your projects and your community?
Violet CoCo: I'm an activist in Extinction Rebellion, a global movement of mass civil resistance
to the systems of government and industry that are currently putting the habitability of our planet
at risk.
[...]
I came to the conclusion that my highest duty ... was to contribute to the greater good. This gave
me the freedom to choose to focus on working with Extinction Rebellion, rather than pursuing more
individualistic goals.
[...]
As [British natural history broadcaster] Sir David Attenborough says, 'We cannot be radical
enough' ... I'm persuaded by both moral and practical arguments that we now have an obligation to
engage in nonviolent civil disobedience. This means creating a deliberate disruption to daily life in
order to highlight hidden injustices

character in others, and consequent support of false beliefs. Habitual want of care about what
believe leads to habitual want of care in others about the truth of what is told to me. Men speak
the truth to one another when each reveres the truth in his own mind and in the other's mind; but
how shall my friend revere the truth in my mind when I myself am careless about it, when I believe
thing[s] because I want to believe them, and because they are comforting and pleasant? Will he
not learn to cry, ""Peace,"" to me, when there is no peace? By such a course I shall surround myself
with a thick atmosphere of falsehood and fraud, and in that I must live. It may matter little to me,
in my cloud-castle of sweet illusions and darling lies; but it matters much to Man that I have made
my neighbours ready to deceive. The credulous man is father to the liar and the cheat; he lives in
the bosom of this his family, and it is no marvel if he should become even as they are. So closely
are our duties knit together, that whoso shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is
guilty of all.
