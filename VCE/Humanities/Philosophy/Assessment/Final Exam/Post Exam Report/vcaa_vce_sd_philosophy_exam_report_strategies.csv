Humanities,Philosophy,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEPHERA,VCEPH25EQA1,VCEPHERAER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 1c,StudentResponse,The following is an example of a high-scoring response to Question 1:,"a) Nietzsche criticizes what he describes as 'slave morality', the morality of the majority that believes in trying to minimize suffering. To Nietzsche, modes of morality that assess things based on pleasure and pain ignore the benefits of suffering: that it allows for the development of greatness amongst mankind. He argues that all of the greatest achievements of mankind have come about due to suffering, and argues for the discipline of suffering. This could be seen as a type of self-discipline, in which case Nietzsche would agree that self-discipline is a key ingredient in the good life. However, as he disagrees with modes of morality that assess based on the amount of pleasure and pain, self-discipline that aims at minimizing suffering would be ridiculous to him and a part of the morality of the herd.",14
Humanities,Philosophy,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEPHERA,VCEPH25EQA1,VCEPHERAER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 1c,StudentResponse,,"b) Callicles argues for the hedonist view that pleasure is the key to the good life, arguing that we should let our desires grow as much as possible, rather than try to limit them. To justify his view, Callicles turns to nature, arguing that natural law has made some individuals stronger than others, thus nature wants those individuals to use their strength to grow their pleasure, even if it's at the expense of the naturally weak. Callicles would disagree with Nietzsche's view on the discipline of suffering, seeing all forms of self-discipline as a hindrance to desire and thus incompatible with the good life. However, his views on the naturally weak and the naturally strong mirror Nietzsche's, with both thinkers see the morality of the weak/slave as a way to try to suppress the strength of the strong. Callicles however, thinks that pleasure is the most important thing, while Nietzsche believes it is suffering.",15
Humanities,Philosophy,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEPHERA,VCEPH25EQA1,VCEPHERAER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 1c,StudentResponse,,"c) I believe that suffering plays a role in the good life, agreeing with Nietzsche that suffering often allows for immense growth of strength and character. Without knowing suffering, happiness wouldn't feel as good as we would have nothing to compare it to. Some of the greatest pieces of art have been created because of suffering. However, I don't believe that all suffering is necessary. Take for example a young child suffering greatly from an illness and dying. What did that child gain from suffering? Moreover, imagine a deer in the forest who gets gravely injured and has to suffer for days before passing away from injury. What does that deer gain? It cannot grow from suffering the same way we can. It cannot learn and ultimately dies. I believe that we only think suffering is important because we experience it, because we don't know any different, thus we give a reason for it. I think that if we didn't have to suffer at all, if we had the choice between experiencing suffering or not, we would choose not to. It is only because we don't have the choice that we believe it is necessary.",16

Additionally, high-scoring responses were likely to demonstrate a complex and nuanced understanding of 'society's goods' as required by the viewpoint provided in the prompt, and as described in the passage provided; for example, that Aristotle argues that honour is a 'good' and so by extension Allen argues for an understanding of 'goods' beyond merely materialist or wealth-focused understandings of 'society's goods', by 'drawing on' Aristotle's approach.",,18

Some students also found meaningful connections to more modern philosophers, such as Mill, Weil and Singer. In the case of Mill, that justice was a matter of the protection of necessary liberties, and so governments ('regimes') responsible for the distribution of goods should act with that principle of justice in mind, rather than equality. In the case of Weil, that we each have eternal obligations to all other humans deriving from their intrinsic nature as humans, and that it is through the distribution of goods that these obligations can be justly exercised. In the case of Singer, that goods should be distributed evenly to the point of marginal utility, and that in order to achieve this it is just that the affluent be called upon to give a greater share and receive a lesser share than those in greater need.",,24

Humanities,Philosophy,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEPHERA,VCEPH25EQA2,VCEPHERAER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 2c,StudentResponse,The following is an example of a high-scoring response to Question 2:,"a) Allen believes that justice involves the fair and equal agency of all citizens in society, with the concept and application of justice being applied in two distinct ways: distributive and straightening-out justice. Distributive justice involves the proportional allotment of public goods in accordance to need such as the starving and homeless receiving more food than those who are rich and can feed themselves. This approach to justice affirms the concept that society's goods should be distributed unevenly, protecting substantive equality.",29
Humanities,Philosophy,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEPHERA,VCEPH25EQA2,VCEPHERAER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 2c,StudentResponse,,"b) Callicles would agree that uneven distribution of goods is just. He believes that true justice lies in the strong dominating the weak and taking more than them in accordance to the natural law of might being right. As such, Callicles supports the uneven distribution of goods in its entirety so long as the strong receive more than the weak. For him, conventional morality concerning justice of equality is simply arbitrary rules made by the weak to suppress the strong and stop them from getting more than their fair share. As nature is naturally opposed to convention, Callicles promotes the strong abandoning societal expectations of equality as being true justice.",30
Humanities,Philosophy,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEPHERA,VCEPH25EQA2,VCEPHERAER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 2c,StudentResponse,,"c) I believe that equality is vital for a good life, specifically for a good life with others. For the most part I agree with Allen's concept of equitable self-interest: we desire to live in a society that is well and hence must recognize that the benefit of others is also a benefit to ourselves. In sacrificing selfish or rivalrous greed and inequal provision of goods, we are able to extend a sense of friendship to other citizens, decreasing that rivalry that dictates us wanting more than others. In recognising that equality is vital for preserving the public bond, ensuring that everyone has an equal share is the best way to promote social cohesion and peace, a characteristic that is the ultimate goal for any collectivity or democracy that requires us to live a good life surrounded by people,",31

To take a strong stance on moral issues cultivates a sense of purpose and identity in one's life, however if this stance causes severe harm to others then this stance should be suppressed. For example, in the case CoCo's advocacy for government action on climate change, she advocates for this issue in a civil, nonviolent manner. Although it causes disobedience, disruption and inconvenience among other citizens, it does not cause harm to others. However, if this initiative were to cause harm to other individuals it would be more morally concerning and may be more dangerous to others than the issue they're advocating for. Therefore, I believe that the good life involves taking a strong moral stance, given that it is also conducive to other views in the process.",44
Humanities,Philosophy,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEPHERA,VCEPH25EQA3,VCEPHERAER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 3c,StudentResponse,,"b) Weil would agree that it is morally required to engage in nonviolent civil disobedience given that it supports the needs of the souls of other individuals. Weil argues this because of her belief that our obligations are unconditional and eternal and thus exist in a ""realm situated above our own"". Weil would argue that if civil disobedience is her conviction to participate in then Weil would support that it is a moral obligation. On the other hand, Peter Singer would differ by saying that if this civil disobedience does not prevent suffering for those who are in danger of suffering then the disobedience is meaningless. In this case, CoCo states that the sixth mass destruction is likely to extinguish 98% of the human population so Singer would argue that the prevention of suffering through the advocacy of climate change is necessary in order to prevent people from suffering in the future.",45
Humanities,Philosophy,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEPHERA,VCEPH25EQA3,VCEPHERAER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 3c,StudentResponse,,"c) I would argue that Singer's view is the more compelling response as he provides practical reasoning for why we have such obligations to such clauses as opposed to Weil who simplifies our obligations to a ""moral imperative"". However, Singer's view is often difficult to apply in our daily lives as he places a very strict requirement for us to prioritise giving provisions to other countries or people in need in order to prevent suffering. For example, by giving money to charities like the ""Bengal relief"" as opposed to spending $20,000 on a new car that we don't need. This would surely prevent us from enjoying our lives as it doesn't allow for individuals to spend money on minor things that have sentimental value. Nonetheless, Singer rebuts this by arguing that we should only give to the extent that it does not cause comparable harm to us. Thus, I agree with Singer's view on why we should have obligations.",46

So, if one individual does not care about the truth and promotes the vices of carelessness and laziness, the others around him will not revere the truth in their mind and learn to cry ""peace"" when there is no peace. Such a carelessness results in an environment of falsehood and fraud, where the individual has made his neighbours ready to deceive, and he himself being credulous, creates liars and cheats. Therefore, we have a serious responsibility to ourselves and others to form true beliefs, because if we don't, we weaken our own character and compromise those around us.",57
Humanities,Philosophy,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEPHERA,VCEPH25EQA4,VCEPHERAER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 4c,StudentResponse,,"b) Peirce largely does not agree with Clifford on our responsibilities to society and ourselves when forming beliefs. This is because Peirce argues that the sole object of inquiry is the settlement of doubt. Peirce argues that we wish at all costs to avoid the great anxiety that arises from doubt. Clifford in fact agrees with Peirce on this point, as he argues that there is a great bitterness that arises when our beliefs are unsure. Peirce, then, presents the scientific method, which although uses evidence to form beliefs that are likely to be true, is based off the premise that it will be the best method at preventing doubt. Thus, Peirce differs from Clifford as he does not care about whether the beliefs are true or not, or even how we get our beliefs like Clifford, but rather that we can settle our beliefs in order to settle the doubt and avoid the great anxiety that comes with being unsure.",58
Humanities,Philosophy,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEPHERA,VCEPH25EQA4,VCEPHERAER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 4c,StudentResponse,,"c) I mostly agree with Clifford that it is dangerous to hold false beliefs, even if they are comforting and pleasant. In my view, the implications of beliefs that are wrong are great and pose a threat both to the individual and to society as a whole. For example, on an individual scale, if we take an individual who believes that the sun won't burn them, then, in the future, we would see that this false belief which is based upon no evidence or inquiry would likely see them contract skin cancer and live a difficult life that would only have been prevented by forming the true belief that the sun will burn them. On the societal scale too we can see that it is dangerous to hold false beliefs. For example if an individual believed that fire didn't pose a threat to anyone, and so he sets his local park on fire, it is easy to see the devastating impacts on others' lives that false beliefs can have. However, at the same time, these are mostly extreme examples, in some cases it is not dangerous to hold beliefs which could be false, but rather it could be beneficial. For example, if I was anxious about a test, but I knew I had studied for it, even if it may be false that I will do it well, believing this would likely result in the best outcome as it suppresses my anxiety (similar to Peirce's model) and would likely result in me performing better. Therefore, in most cases it is dangerous at an individual and societal level to hold beliefs that are false, but there are some circumstances where the stakes are less extreme and settling a belief, even if it may be false, would likely result in a better outcome.",59

This instruction, similarly with the instruction in Section A, Question 3, required students not merely to mention or reference a chosen case study, but for that case study to be the central concern of the essay. Many students were able to demonstrate this by opening their essay with an outline of the chosen case study and then introducing the two chosen thinkers in terms of how their works would be relevant to the case study (although this isn't a required structure of the essay, and some high-scoring essays were not structured this way). Teachers could consider having a discussion with students to clarify what is meant by 'central example'.

For example, 'medical misogyny' and 'social media misinformation' were both popular choices, and many responses demonstrated understanding and relevant application of these topics as case studies for their essay by referring to these phenomena in general ways (e.g. that the disproportionate ratio of male to female doctors and the lack of medical testing on female populations led to drugs or treatments that were not appropriate for female patients; that the proliferation of misinformation on social media has led to a breakdown in public trust of information etc.). These were valid case studies to consider and were often applied in ways that were relevant to the prompt the student was addressing; however, high-scoring responses included another layer of specificity. For example, that medical misogyny was especially apparent in the case of the children of thalidomide, or in the underdiagnosis or misdiagnosis of endometriosis; or that social media misinformation was especially apparent in the spread of the QAnon conspiracy theory which led to 'Pizzagate' and thus to a shooting in a Washington pizza shop. These more precise and detailed examples allowed students more opportunities to demonstrate skills and knowledge.

Mill contends that, upon being exposed to beliefs, one is exposed to truth, a belief that contains a portion of the truth, or even if a belief is wrong, it can challenge the grounds of one's own argument, preventing it from being held as a habit rather than a heartfelt conviction. In all cases, the hearer improves their belief and prevents it from forming into unjustified principle. To engage in open debate, Mill contends that we must cultivate epistemic virtues such as temperate discussion and the willingness to listen to others. To do otherwise is to form epistemic vices such as the suppression of arguments or the misrepresentation of opinions. Therefore, to Mill, controversial opinions do more good than harm so long as they are justified and expressed in a reasonable and temperate manner.",24

Although the government did not suppress any beliefs, they did not provide enough robust reasoning and arguments for citizens to develop their own beliefs. According to the Rule of Law article - an official site for the education of Australian laws - the coalition was excluded from any meaningful discussion and there was a lack of debate, claiming that the referendum was ""based on the concept of the Voice ... rather than a detailed model for its implementation."" As a result, there was a lack of clarity to what exactly the referendum would do for the nation and an assumption as to what the citizens knew. Thus, it is likely that the citizens formed controversial opinions but they were unjustified because of a lack of clear reasoning. This failure to help form justified contrary opinions did not only occur by the Albanese government. The opposition advocated for the slogan ""if you don't know, vote no"" which supported/fostered epistemic vices of ignorance and epistemic laziness. Therefore, to Mill, controversial opinions did more harm than good due to a lack of robust reasoning and clear arguments that undermined Mill's principle for justified and reasoned debate.",26

Short form content, emojis and one-word tweets do not contribute reasoned argument, often perpetuating negativity and emotion.

On the other hand, M. Fricker exposes prejudice's surreptitious nature and contends that controversial opinions can cause more harm than good in society if they are soaked in prejudice. Fricker uses the example of Mr Greenleaf (a civic-minded and reasonable man) who believed Marge wasn't telling the truth because, like other females, she was going off instinct rather than facts, thus attributing her a credibility deficit. The detrimental issue is that Greenleaf tried hard to listen to the evidence but did not know his perception of the truth was distorted by prejudice. As a result, Marge's epistemic autonomy and dignity was undermined, causing a testimonial injustice, harming her as a knower, and Greenleaf was harmed as he missed out on the truth.

As its intention was to ""remove any doubt that the constitution had discriminated against people of the Aboriginal race"", according to the Rule of law article, it seems that the Voice mechanism would have been a useful vessicle for us to reassess our credibility judgements and correct for lurking prejudices.

For example, a teacher may label a student as less intelligent, resulting in a credibility deficit. This not only hams the student by dismissing their contributions to the class, it also impoverishes the classroom's collective understanding. Yet, even if the referendum was successful, I do not think it would have gone far enough to achieve epistemic justice. What would it mean to see Indigenous people as equal knowers in their own right? According to the head of the Indigenous Health equity unit at Melbourne University, there are ingrained ""problematic colonial thought processes"". Western scientific knowledge values rationality and dominance over nature, but there is also more holistic and communal ""ways of knowing"". For example, there are instances when we can learn from Indigenous knowledge such as how to ""mitigate and adapt for climate change"" or ""holistic models of wellbeing"". But the paradigm of ""Western scientific ways of knowing"" such as ""Western knowledge is superior to Indigenous knowledge"" dismisses their contribution as irrelevant or inferior.
