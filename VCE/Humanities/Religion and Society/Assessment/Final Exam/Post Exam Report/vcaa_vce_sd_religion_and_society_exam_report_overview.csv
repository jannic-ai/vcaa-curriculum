Humanities,Religion and Society,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCERSER,VCERSERGC,General Comments,,"The 2024 Religion and Society examination was completed well, with many responses demonstrating students' broad understanding of the knowledge required in the study, although supporting details were often missing. Where students were required to draw on skills in their responses, such as describing, evaluating, demonstrating and examining, they often made claims but lacked supporting detail for these claims or else the claims were irrelevant.",,0
Humanities,Religion and Society,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCERSER,VCERSERGC,General Comments,,"Responses in this examination demonstrated that students have a broad understanding of religious traditions and religious denominations in general, as well as of the specific religious traditions or religious denominations. Many students were able to determine whether the question presented to them was intended to be about religions generally or was intended to be answered using the specific knowledge of religious traditions or religious denominations that they had studied.",,1
Humanities,Religion and Society,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCERSER,VCERSERGC,General Comments,,"Most students attempted to incorporate sources from their respective religious traditions or religious denominations when attempting to answer questions. These sources needed to be relevant and accurate to be awarded marks in the examination. Some responses included exceptionally detailed quotes, references, or statistics, but at times these details were unnecessary and were not relevant to the question at hand. Students should consider not only what they have learnt in terms of source material, but why they are adding it into their work. Material that does not expand on the question being asked can be considered irrelevant and will not be awarded marks. Students should not expect to be awarded marks simply for providing quotes they have memorised.",,2
Humanities,Religion and Society,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCERSER,VCERSERGC,General Comments,,"This examination included four questions for which students were required in their responses to clearly state or describe beliefs relevant to the religious tradition or religious denomination that they had studied. Responses to these questions demonstrated a divide between those that selected and described precise beliefs in a religious tradition or religious denomination, and those that referred to the categories of beliefs or vaguely and inaccurately described the beliefs of a religious tradition or religious denomination.",,3

Humanities,Religion and Society,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCERSER,VCERSERGC,General Comments,,"Responses that inaccurately described the belief in the religious tradition or religious denomination could be significantly limited in their ability to engage with the question and enter into a deeper discussion of the way in which those beliefs, and the associated aspects of religion, were relevant to the religious tradition or religious denomination, its members or an individual studied. It is recommended that schools and students carefully select their beliefs in Unit 3 Area of Study 1 to ensure students can be fully prepared for the examination and equipped to offer depth in responding to the study design key knowledge and key skills.",,18
Humanities,Religion and Society,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCERSER,VCERSERGC,General Comments,,"Additionally, there were three questions for which students were required to describe the challenges faced by their nominated religious tradition or religious denomination. Responses were required to discuss three different challenges out of the four that students would have studied throughout the year. Students should prepare one to two very precise sentences on each of the four challenges they have studied throughout the year and be prepared to leverage these sentences in the questions focused on challenges. It is vital for responses to accurately describe the specific situation that the religious tradition or religious denomination faced, as it allows the assessor to understand and engage with the rest of the response and generally leads to a stronger response to the question. Where descriptions of the challenge were vague or inaccurate, the rest of the response could also suffer, as it made it difficult for the assessors to determine clear links between the challenge presented and the rest of the response.",,19
Humanities,Religion and Society,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCERSER,VCERSERGC,General Comments,,Descriptions of the challenge being presented could have included details such as:,,20

Humanities,Religion and Society,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCERSER,VCERSERGC,General Comments,,"the date or time in which the challenge took place, such as 2016, or the 18th and 19th centuries CE",,22

Humanities,Religion and Society,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCERSER,VCERSERGC,General Comments,,"what was being threatened in the tradition, or what opportunity was being presented by the situation, such as a link to a precise belief being threatened, a description of the heresies, or the number of adherents killed.",,24
Humanities,Religion and Society,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCERSER,VCERSERGC,General Comments,,A number of responses in the examination could have been improved by being precise and accurate with their explanation of the challenge presented. Suggestions for improvement include the following:,,25

Humanities,Religion and Society,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCERSER,VCERSERGC,General Comments,,"The heresies of Baruch Spinoza (17th century) in Judaism - explain what Spinoza's philosophy was and how it contradicted the divine authority of the Torah, or his rejection of the immortality of the soul.",,29
Humanities,Religion and Society,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCERSER,VCERSERGC,General Comments,,"This examination required students to know and understand the function of the aspects of religion across all areas of study. In particular, the specific way in which the aspects of religion are involved in challenges, or used in the resolution (or attempted resolution) of challenges; the role of particular aspects of religion in responding to the search for meaning; or the expression of beliefs in the religion, and the way in which aspects of religion are affected in significant life experiences. Students should familiarise themselves with the idea that when beliefs are expressed, they must be experienced through the remaining aspects of religion - texts, rituals, social structures and so on - as is the unique phenomenological experience of religion. When questions ask for responses to describe, identify or explain the way in which a belief is expressed, or how the expressions of beliefs change, or how the expressions of beliefs influence the search for meaning, students should engage with the aspects of religion directly and by naming them.",,30

Some lower-scoring responses did not utilise case studies effectively to support arguments or evaluations, as they focused on excessive biographical detail and did not identify the chosen figure's precise religious beliefs.",,46

Humanities,Religion and Society,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCERSER,VCERSERGC,General Comments,,"Some of these challenges were not successful choices, as responses indicated confusion over the focus of the challenge. In both Unit 4 Areas of Study 1 and 2, the focus of the challenge is the religious tradition, not an individual or group. Also, the religious tradition or religious denomination is the focus for discussion of the stances, the supporting responses, and the consequences of the religious tradition or religious denomination. The knowledge and understanding of some challenges presented in responses seemed limited by insufficient research. There were also factual errors and, for the detailed challenge of Area of Study 2, a lack of relevant wider context. Some challenges were so broad over time and place that responses made unsupported overgeneralisations rather than staying with a focused timeframe in order to address the question. In their responses, students are recommended to limit the timeframe to the stated historical or contemporary period. This requires selecting content from their broad study that best fits the question.",,72
