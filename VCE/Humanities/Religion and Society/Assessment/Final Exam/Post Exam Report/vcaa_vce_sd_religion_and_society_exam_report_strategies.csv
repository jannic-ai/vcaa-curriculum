His stance was that modernity was catastrophic or the Jewish tradition, and that Judaism could not in any way compromise with it. Here, the intended outcome was to maintain the authenticity and integrity of Judaism, and beyond resolving the tension and thus the challenge itself, they wanted to re-establish the Jewish way of life that had been practiced in the Ghettos. Thus, the movement's supporting response was the motto ""Chadash asur min Hatorah"", meaning ""that which is new is forbidden by the Torah"". This included the rejection of any introduction or abandonment of Jewish rituals, the reinterpretation of sacred texts and teachings, or any changes which could compromise the Jewish tradition whatsoever. Through their fundamentalist stances and supporting responses, the Ultra-Orthodox movement were able to ""protect the integrity of their ancient faith"" (Louis Jacobs), and by advocating for Jewish isolation, they effectively brought back the ghetto life of Judaism's past.",57

Humanities,Religion and Society,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCERSERB,VCERS25EQB5,VCERSERBER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 5b,StudentResponse,,"The sacred story of Creation, expressed the belief in this One Triune and Incarnate God as this God created humanity in his image and likeness (Gen 1:27). This expression supports meaning in Catholic's lives by boosting their emotional wellbeing as they recognize that by being made in the image of God, their lives are precious. The sacred story of Christ's crucifixion expresses the belief in this God, as God the Son came down from heaven and laid down his life for humanity so that ""whoever believes in Him may not perish"" (John 3:16). This expression assists Catholics find meaning by providing answers to the existential question such as 'why do I suffer' as they recognize that even Christ who was ""infinitely good"" (CCC 385) had to ""suffer much"" (St Teresa of Calcutta), reminding Catholics that they are never alone. The sacred story of Christ's baptism, expresses the belief in this Trinitarian God as during the baptism, all three persons of the Trinity ""the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit"" (Mt 28:19) were present. This assists Catholics in supporting meaning as they realise that in their lives too, this Trinitarian God is ""fully present"" (Pennsylvania Bishop's Conference), strengthening their relationship with God through recognizing His real and immanent presence in their lives.",69
