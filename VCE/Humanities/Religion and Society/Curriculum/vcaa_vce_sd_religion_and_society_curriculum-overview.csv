In VCE Religion and Society, religion is defined as a community organised around beliefs related to ultimate reality and the consequent beliefs, practices, principles and codes for behaviour. Adherence to particular beliefs, practices, principles and codes can form an important part of individual identity. They can determine membership of the religion and the transmission of meaning, both individual and collective, from generation to generation. Within each religious tradition, groups and individuals exhibit diversity of commitment and belief; some people do not identify with the generalised portrayal of their religious tradition, whereas others become strict adherents.",,1

Throughout history, religion and society have interacted with each other in broad ways in response to a range of important issues. Religion initiates changes to society and vice versa, and the consequences of these dynamic processes are part of the scope of this study. Some religious traditions continue to thrive while others have declined or disappeared or parts of them have been assimilated into other religions, which allows their ideas to live on in some form. New religious movements can develop into religious traditions.",,2

They study specific religious traditions or religious denominations in societies where multiple worldviews coexist and consider the experiences of members as those members engage with their religious tradition individually and communally. This study respects and encourages an open and objective inquiry, without partiality towards any one religion.",,3

Religion has played and continues to play a significant role in the development and maintenance of society. Students come to appreciate that religion can be a positive force of power, authority and justice. However, religious institutions have not always interacted positively with society at large and have at times supported the unethical behaviour of other power structures in society and of individuals; conversely, society has not always interacted positively with religion and has at times supported the unethical behaviour of religions and individuals.",,1

Students explore how such societies and their spiritual and religious traditions negotiate significant ethical issues. Spiritualities and religious traditions offer value systems that guide their adherents' interactions with society and influence society's decision-making. This study offers an insight into the spiritual and religious beliefs and other aspects of religion that express these value systems. Students study the role of religion in supporting adherents to grapple with the big questions of human existence and to respond to significant life experiences.",,2
