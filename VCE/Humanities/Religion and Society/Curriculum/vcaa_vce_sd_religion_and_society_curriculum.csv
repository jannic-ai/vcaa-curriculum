Humanities,Religion and Society,Year 11,Unit 1,VCERSU1AS12,,,,Paragraph,,Unit 1: The role of religion in society,"In this unit students explore the spiritual origins of religion and understand its role in the development of society, identifying the nature and purpose of religion over time. They investigate religion, including the totality of phenomena to which the term 'religion' refers, and acknowledge religion's contribution to the development of human society. They also focus on the role of spiritualities, religious traditions and religious denominations in shaping personal and group identity over time. Students examine how individuals, groups and new ideas have affected and continue to affect spiritualities, religious traditions and religious denominations. The unit provides an opportunity for students to understand the often complex relationships that exist between individuals, groups, new ideas, truth narratives, spiritualities and religious traditions broadly and in the Australian society in which they live.",,1

or not good? Do we accept what society defines as good? Do we do what feels right? Or do we rely on a definition of what is good from a spirituality, religious tradition or religious denomination? What are the principles that guide decision-making? Ethics is concerned with discovering the perspectives that guide practical moral judgment. Studying ethics involves identifying the arguments and analysing the reasoning, and any other influences, behind these perspectives and moral judgments. An important influence on ethical perspective is the method of ethical decision-making, made up of concepts, principles and theories.",,1

In this quest for meaning humans have consistently posed big questions of life such as: Where did we come from? Is there someone or something greater than us - an ultimate reality? What is the purpose of our existence? How should we live? Is there anything beyond death? In response to this search for meaning, various spiritual, religious, philosophical, scientific and ideological worldviews have been developed. Religion has developed answers in the form of a truth narrative: various beliefs and other aspects that have offered ways of establishing meaning, not only for human existence but also for all that exists. The aspects of religion also attempt to express and explain the nature of relationships between humans individually and collectively, between humans and ultimate reality and between humans and the rest of the natural world.",,1

Humanities,Religion and Society,Year 12,Unit 4,VCERSU4AS12,,,,Paragraph,,"Unit 4: Religion, challenge and change","This unit focuses on the interaction over time of religious traditions and religious denominations and the societies of which they are a part. For a large part of human history religion has been drawn on as a truth narrative, offering a means for finding answers to the big questions of life. Religious traditions and religious denominations are in a dynamic process of engagement and negotiation with members individually and collectively, as well as with other key institutions in wider society associated with power, authority and credibility. Religious traditions and religious denominations are living institutions that interact with society and can likewise be influenced by society. They can stimulate and support society, acting as levers for change themselves and embracing or resisting forces for change within society.",,1
Humanities,Religion and Society,Year 12,Unit 4,VCERSU4AS12,,,,Paragraph,,"Unit 4: Religion, challenge and change","Religious traditions and religious denominations are in a constant state of development as members apply their talents and faith to extend the intellectual and aesthetic nature of a tradition's or denomination's beliefs, of the expression of these beliefs and of the application of these beliefs to their lives. Opportunities for development also come from significant challenges in the interaction of religious traditions and religious denominations and society, including the needs and insights of their members and other people and groups within wider society. A challenge is a situation that stimulates a response from society and/or religious traditions and religious denominations. These challenges and the religious tradition and religious denomination are influenced by broader contexts such as changing economic and environmental conditions, and political, social or technological developments.",,2
Humanities,Religion and Society,Year 12,Unit 4,VCERSU4AS12,,,,Paragraph,,"Unit 4: Religion, challenge and change","Religious traditions and religious denominations can take stances for or against challenges, or they can take a stance of indifference. Consequently, actions that involve different aspects of the religious tradition or religious denomination are implemented. These actions may resist or embrace change and affect wider society and/or the religious tradition or religious denomination itself. A key aim beyond resolution of the challenge itself is for religious traditions to retain integrity, authenticity, authority, adherents and, ultimately, identity. However, the interaction between religious traditions and religious denominations and society may not always achieve these aims and there may be a series of interactions as a challenge is negotiated.",,3
