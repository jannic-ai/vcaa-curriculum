Football is often described as 'The World Game' and the 26-man squad selected to represent
Australia at the 2022 FIFA World Cup is a true reflection of the country's multiculturalism, experts
say. About 30 per cent of Australians are born overseas and 49 per cent have at least one parent
born overseas.
Nine players selected in the Socceroos were born overseas, from five different countries. Many
others were born in Australia but come from migrant roots, including Ajdin Hrustic, who has
Romanian and Bosnian heritage, and Awer Mabil and Thomas Deng from South Sudan. Other
Socceroos born overseas named in the squad include Milos Degenek, Fran Karacic, Harry Souttar,
Keanu Baccus, Martin Boyle, Jason Cummings and Garang Kuol.
Professor Ramon Spaaij, from Victoria University's College of Sport and Exercise Science, told
SBS News that diversity in sport can 'build hope'.
'First, you cannot be what you cannot see,' he said. 'Having that visibility and representation of
athletes with diverse backgrounds can build the hope, belief and aspirations .. It helps to break
down that barrier of not seeing yourself represented at that highest level.'
'Embracing diversity in national teams such as the Socceroos can also give collective expression
to a sense of belonging to Australian society more broadly; that is, to a sense of who we are as
multicultural nation that is both diverse and united,' he said.
After announcing its squad earlier this month, the Socceroos released a video saying the lineup
represents Australia's diverse migrant history.
'From fleeing war to finding a home down under,"" Lebanese-Australian actor Firass Dirani says in
the video. 'To leaving home at 14 to chase a dream. Many Journeys. One Jersey. One Squad.'
A statement by Australia's national team in 2020 said football has been a 'space for migrant
communities' since it was established in 1888 . .
'Many of Australia's oldest football clubs were formed by these immigrant groups: the Greeks of
South Melbourne and Sydney Olympic, the Italians of Marconi and Adelaide City, the Croatians of
Melbourne Knights, Sydney United and Perth's Western Knights.'

Now open: The couple behind the Pierogi Pierogi Food Truck open
Polish diner in Brunswick East [Melbourne]
Polish food is hot at Eat Pierogi1 Make Love. Expect brightly garnished 2 dishes [...] and,
course, pierogi at the brutalist 3-inspired shop.
Due to copyright restrictions, this material is not supplied.
The plan was never pierogi. For Eat Pierogi
Make Love founders Guy Daley and Dominka
Sikorska, it was always fashion and music,
respectively. But when the pair were expecting
their first child, they wanted more stability.
They came up with a business plan based on
one of their first activities as a couple: hosting
pierogi parties
Now, the duo have opened their first bricks-and-
mortar joint: the memorably named Eat Pierogi
Make Love. The restaurant's arresting name
has also become their mantra. 'Making love is
spreading love, spreading understanding and
spreading joy - that's what we want to do with
this business,' Daley tells Broadsheet.
They hope the restaurant inspires people to
consider Poland - where Sikorska grew up - and
Polish food beyond the stereotypes. '[Poland is]
not grey, it's not bleak, it's not anything like that.
It's beautiful,' says Daley. 'So making Polish food
sexy is really what we're trying to do.'
Eat Pierogi Make Love adopts a Polish way of
drinking and eating that Daley says is not unlike
the experience you get at a Japanese izakaya4.
The menu puts a youthful twist on traditional
flavours and ingredients. The pierogi options,
naturally, are plentiful and varied - from
traditional pierogi ruskie (potato and cheese)
to a deep-fried vegan offering [jalapeño, potato
and vegan cheese].

The snacky [food] menu includes rainbow pickles,
Polish mountain cheese with cranberry sauce,
mixed pate on rye, and sauerkraut5-and-potato
fritters served with sour cream
The fit-out plays with Polish aesthetics, nodding
to brutalist design with its abundant concrete
and beige grid tiling. Colourful Polish posters,
retro-inspired light fixtures and scattered cobalt
menus add colour.
Keep an eye peeled7 for the restaurant's upcoming
Eat Polska Sunday session: an invitation to
partake in the Polish Sunday family meal tradition.
You can try specialty dishes like kotlety mielone
(turkey and pork meatballs with veg and mash)
and kotlety schabowy (crumbed pork loin cutlets
with young potatoes, salad and kefir 8).

Identify one economic factor and one social factor in Representation 3, and suggest how these factors
might affect the experience of community in Camden.
Voice of Real Australia: Small town values in the middle of suburbia
It's a town just an hour from Sydney steeped in
rich colonial and Indigenous history surrounded
by bustling suburbia.
A town consistently stuck in the push and pull
between preservation and progress
Camden is the kind of town where locals still say
hello as they pass each other on the street, the
business owners always know the best places
to go and the pubs are the place to be on
Saturday night.
Camden's proverbial jewel in the crown,
St John's Church - whose spire can be seen
throughout the town, there's an art gallery in the
(haunted) historic Macaria building, a museum
and plenty more.
The town's annual [agricultural] show's tagline is
'still a country show'
But the challenge Camden faces is somewhat
unique.
Given the town's location in south west Sydney
it is surrounded by large-scale shopping centres,
huge restaurant precincts and tourism hubs like
Bowral, Wollongong and the Blue Mountains are
only a short drive away.
So the town's small businesses face the struggle
of stiff competition nearby.
At shopping centres there is no need to walk all
the way down the street to visit the butcher after
grabbing a coffee - everything is in the one place.
And it's easy to choose to dine at a large-scale
chain restaurant, the recipes are stock standard,
so you know what you are getting every time.
But there's beauty in enjoying a small town.",,14
