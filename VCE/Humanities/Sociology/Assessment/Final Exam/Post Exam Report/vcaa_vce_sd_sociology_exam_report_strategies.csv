Questions required students to apply their knowledge in very specific ways. Students who paid careful attention to the various parts of complex questions and command terms were able to produce high-scoring responses.,,1

Humanities,Sociology,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCESOER,,VCESOERCM,,General Comments,ExaminerCommentary,"Students are reminded of the flow-on nature of multiple-part questions, where part b. follows from part a. For example, Question 9a. required students to describe a type of social movement, and Question 9b. required them to discuss the success of this movement. If students discussed a different movement in part b., marks could not be awarded. Outside these multiple-part questions, all questions are standalone. For example, Question 10 asked students to analyse how power was used by a social movement, and many students saw this as a follow-on from Questions 9a. and 9b. and therefore did not provide the context of the movement or its opposition.",,8
Humanities,Sociology,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCESOER,,VCESOERCM,,General Comments,ExaminerCommentary,"In 2024, several areas of the new study design were assessed, with various levels of understanding displayed by students. While many students were able to demonstrate an understanding of Michel Maffesoli's theory of neo-tribes - loose-knit communities connected by shared interests that are flexible, fluid and less interdependent - the examples chosen did not reflect this type of community. Similarly, many students who were able to provide a general understanding of Erica Chenoweth's research into the nonviolent tactics used by social movements were not always able to succinctly link this to tactics used by their chosen social movement.",,9

It is referred to as a process as it requires long term effort to heal the scars caused from decades of Indigenous inequality and injustice. The 'apology to the stolen generations' (2008) to a large extent was successful as it had enabled the traumatic history of Indigenous children to be acknowledged publicly. This allows Indigenous people to feel a sense of healing as their past suppression is not overlooked, rather it has enabled non-Indigenous people to adopt a culturally relativistic mindset of Indigenous culture and sympathise with their loss.",28

The 'Change the Date of Australia Day' campaign and repatriation of artefacts were both appropriate common choices.

Due to the dispossession during colonisation, First Nations people have lost over 100,000 cultural artefacts and human remains to overseas collecting institutions such as the British Museum (AIATSIS, 2022) ... as a result, awareness, what is known or understood, about Aboriginal culture is severely limited ... therefore, this will increase public awareness of Indigenous culture, which one Gwewal man said would 'benefit [them] and [their] whole community' [SBS].",36
