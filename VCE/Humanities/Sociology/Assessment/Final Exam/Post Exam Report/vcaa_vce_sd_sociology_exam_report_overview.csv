Humanities,Sociology,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCESOER,VCESOERGC,General Comments,,"Students are reminded of the flow-on nature of multiple-part questions, where part b. follows from part a. For example, Question 9a. required students to describe a type of social movement, and Question 9b. required them to discuss the success of this movement. If students discussed a different movement in part b., marks could not be awarded. Outside these multiple-part questions, all questions are standalone. For example, Question 10 asked students to analyse how power was used by a social movement, and many students saw this as a follow-on from Questions 9a. and 9b. and therefore did not provide the context of the movement or its opposition.",,8

While many students were able to demonstrate an understanding of Michel Maffesoli's theory of neo-tribes - loose-knit communities connected by shared interests that are flexible, fluid and less interdependent - the examples chosen did not reflect this type of community. Similarly, many students who were able to provide a general understanding of Erica Chenoweth's research into the nonviolent tactics used by social movements were not always able to succinctly link this to tactics used by their chosen social movement.",,9

Humanities,Sociology,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCESOER,VCESOERGC,General Comments,,"The misconception that all Indigenous people share one culture has numerous sources, including the failure of the media to describe the specific cultural group of Indigenous people, which has ""contributed to people seeing an Aboriginal woman...rather than a 'Noongar' woman"" (Creative Spirits, 2022)...In reality, Indigenous people belong to a diverse and huge range of cultural groups, seen through their variety of languages, of which 167 Indigenous languages are still spoken today (ABS, 2021). Furthermore, these groups have different material and non-material culture, such as the Koori Bunjil and the Yolungu people Rainbow Serpent.

As such, many moved from their close-knit relations to cities, which is known as the process of urbanisation. In this move, community went from close-knit like the Adass community holding homogenous views about aspect of the like to gesellschaft; society such as the Endeavor Hills community that displayed a lack of close knit relations, instead forming contractual relations based on mutual benefit for the two parties.",,112

This is because they defy geographical boundaries, subsequently enabling individuals to foster relationships on a communal basis across the globe. In the aftermath of the invention of these technologies, sociologist Michel Maffesoli devised the concept of neo-tribes, or dynamic and loosely-formed communities where members are brought together by a shared interest in seeking a sense of belonging.",,113

Bureaucratisation has allowed for the high levels of organization needed to conduct their operation, thus, the movement's successful usage of power can be attributed to it.
