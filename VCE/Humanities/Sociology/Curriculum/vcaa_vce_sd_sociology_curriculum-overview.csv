Humanities,Sociology,Years 11 and 12,,VCESO12OVSC01,Scope of study,,Paragraph,"Sociology focuses on the study of human behaviour and social interaction to understand how societies are organised, develop and change. There is no single sociological perspective, rather, there are several theories that offer different ways of understanding human society. Sociologists use these theories and frameworks in a complementary way to attempt to objectively examine social issues and explain concepts. In VCE Sociology students examine key theories regarding family, deviance, ethnicity, community and social movements.",,1
Humanities,Sociology,Years 11 and 12,,VCESO12OVSC02,Scope of study,,Paragraph,"Understanding society from a sociological perspective involves the use of what the sociologist Charles Wright Mills (1959) described as a sociological imagination, that is, a constantly critiquing mindset. In VCE Sociology students learn about and apply the sociological imagination by questioning their assumptions and reflecting on their understandings and ideas about social relations.",,2
Humanities,Sociology,Years 11 and 12,,VCESO12OVSC03,Scope of study,,Paragraph,"Sociology draws on scientific method in the exploration of social relationships and the outcomes of social activities. The scientific method is a systematic process applied to research questions and problems in an attempt to achieve objective observation, collection and analysis of data. Sociologists work to develop a reliable and valid body of knowledge based on research. In doing so, they adhere to various ethical codes of conduct. The primary goal of research ethics is to protect the wellbeing of the groups and individuals with whom sociologists work. There are many different ways that students can gather information for analysis in the course of their study, such as case studies, surveys and participant observation. As students gather and use sources of evidence, they explore and apply the Australian Sociological Association's guidelines for conducting research.",,3
Humanities,Sociology,Years 11 and 12,,VCESO12OVRA01,Rationale,,Paragraph,"The study of VCE Sociology assists in the development of an appreciation of cultural diversity, and in an understanding of human behaviour and social structures. Further, it directs students' attention to how aspects of society are interrelated, as well as to the causes and impacts of social change.",,1
Humanities,Sociology,Years 11 and 12,,VCESO12OVRA02,Rationale,,Paragraph,"VCE Sociology provides valuable knowledge and skills for participation in everyday life. It develops a capacity for detailed observation of social patterns and group behaviour, and encourages students to become aware of and to think about daily life and activities, as well as wider social issues, from a sociological perspective. This study broadens students' insights into key sociological frameworks and social institutions, enabling them to pursue further formal study at a tertiary level or in vocational education and training settings.",,2
Humanities,Sociology,Years 11 and 12,,VCESO12OVRA03,Rationale,,Paragraph,"The study of VCE Sociology can lead to tertiary pathways related to work with social groups and social processes, such as in culture resource management and community development, or work with minority and ethnic groups. It can lead to work in fields that address issues such as crime and substance abuse, youth and family matters, industrial relations, social justice and social issues related to healthcare. The study of VCE Sociology helps develop social research skills, including: creating and conducting surveys, collecting data and conducting interviews and fieldwork, including the analysis, interpretation and presentation of the information collected.",,3
