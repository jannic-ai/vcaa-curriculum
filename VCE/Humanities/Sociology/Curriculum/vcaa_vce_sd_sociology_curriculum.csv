Humanities,Sociology,Year 11,Unit 1,VCESOU1AS12,,,,UnitHeader,,Unit 1: Youth and family,,,0
Humanities,Sociology,Year 11,Unit 1,VCESOU1AS12,,,,Paragraph,,Unit 1: Youth and family,"In this unit, students use sociological methodology to explore the social category of youth and the social institution of family. Sociologists draw on methods of science to understand how and why people behave the way they do when they interact in a group. Sociology attempts to understand human society from a holistic point of view, including consideration of society's composition, how it is reproduced over time and the differences between societies. When sociologists investigate a topic, they attempt to do so with a reflective, critical mindset. Sociologists are guided by theories, or frameworks, to explain and analyse how social action, social processes and social structures work.",,1
Humanities,Sociology,Year 11,Unit 1,VCESOU1AS12,,,,Paragraph,,Unit 1: Youth and family,"In Area of Study 1, students explore the way youth is constructed as a social category, in the light of differing experiences of young people. Students examine how and why the experience of being young differs across time and space. They examine a range of factors that lead to different experiences of youth, as well as the potential negative impacts of homogenous categorisation, such as stereotypes of young people in a context characterised by a rich diversity in the ways young people live.",,2
Humanities,Sociology,Year 11,Unit 1,VCESOU1AS12,,,,Paragraph,,Unit 1: Youth and family,"In Area of Study 2, students investigate the social institution of the family. In a multicultural society like Australia, different communities have different kinds of families and experiences of family life. Students explore various factors that influence the diversity of these experiences such as demographic shifts, as well as cultural, economic, technological and social developments. A range of theoretical approaches are used by sociologists to explain the purpose and experiences of family life, including functionalist and feminist approaches. Comparative methodologies also enable comparison of family types and family experiences across time and space.",,3
