Humanities,Classical Studies,Year 11,Unit 1,VCECSU1AS12,,,,Paragraph,,Unit 1: Mythical worlds,"Myths are traditional narratives that examine ideas of central importance to a society. They were used by the Greeks and the Romans to explain the world, the foundation of institutions, aspects of daily life and the human condition. In the classical world, myth encompassed the nature of the gods, the deeds of heroes like Achilles and Theseus, and the epic voyages of Odysseus and Aeneas. Women such as Helen, Clytemnestra and Dido have endured in myths that contemplate love and war, the human and the monstrous. Students examine the nature and function of selected myths and consider the influence of the myths studied on modern culture.",,2
Humanities,Classical Studies,Year 11,Unit 1,VCECSU1AS12,,,,Paragraph,,Unit 1: Mythical worlds,"Students also explore the history of archaeology in the Mediterranean Basin, observing how the pioneers of archaeology sought to explain the possible historical basis of particular myths. They excavated sites such as Hisarlik (believed to be Troy), Knossos and Mycenae in search of the mythical heroes and their worlds. Students study archaeological sites connected to myths and consider the relationship between a myth and its archaeological record, such as site features and material culture. They critically assess whether there is a historical basis for the myth and draw evidence from the archaeological record to reach conclusions about the society that inhabited the site. Students engage with current debates about the ethics of archaeology and ownership of the past.",,3
