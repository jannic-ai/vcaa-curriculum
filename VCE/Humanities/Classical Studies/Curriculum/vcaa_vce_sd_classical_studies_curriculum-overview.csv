These ideas have intrigued and influenced Western societies for centuries. By examining the written works (in translation) and material culture of these two ancient societies, students of Classical Studies develop a rich understanding of the intellectual and cultural life of these cultures.",,1

Students consider these works in their socio-historical contexts, evaluating and comparing what they reveal about the ideas, beliefs and attitudes of the society in which they were created.",,2

By exploring their answers, Classical Studies helps us to understand the humanity of the classical world and in turn to better understand ourselves. Students are taken from their known world by engaging deeply with another culture that is simultaneously familiar and strange. In studying classical works, students encounter people that might seem familiar among the defenders of Troy, the competitors at the Olympic Games, the spectators at Athenian drama festivals and the witnesses to the struggles in the Roman Senate.",,2

They engage deeply with the past, with diverse perspectives, experiences and worldviews, forming a deep cultural understanding of peoples from other times and places. This helps students to appreciate the traditions and values of others. Those with a deeper understanding of the past are well-positioned to draw lessons from it, while also having a better understanding of the other cultures, values and points of view that they encounter in the present.",,3

Students are introduced to the development of ideas that are still important today. The inquiry into classical works and the societies that produced them creates rich opportunities to learn about the past and gain a clearer understanding of the modern world. Students develop skills in textual analysis, analysing written and visual evidence, comparing works and constructing arguments, while thinking critically and understanding the significance and influence of external factors such as socio-historical context. These are lifelong skills that are transferable across a range of disciplines and integral to the development of active and engaged citizens in a diverse and changing world.",,4
