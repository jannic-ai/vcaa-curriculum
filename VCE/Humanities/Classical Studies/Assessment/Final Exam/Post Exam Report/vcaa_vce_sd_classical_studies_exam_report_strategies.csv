Humanities,Classical Studies,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCECSERB,VCECS25EQB6,VCECSERBCM,,Question 6,ExaminerCommentary,"Responses described how Aristophanes' Lysistrata presents contrasting models of leadership. Lysistrata emerges as a powerful, strategic leader who unites the women in a sex strike, seizes the Acropolis, and negotiates peace, whereas the comedy exposes male mismanagement. Students drew on Pericles' ideal democratic leadership as demonstrated in his Funeral Oration and Nicostratus' effective leadership in his attempts to restore order in Corcyra. A number of responses made good use of the leadership displayed by Artemesia in one of the Herodotus extracts for classical concerns. However, overall few students responding to this text pairing made reference to the classical concerns works.",,40

However, the responses largely tended toward descriptions of good and bad people, without specific consideration of corruption. Many students skirted around the question and did not address whether Rome was entirely good or bad. Higher-scoring responses explicitly grappled with the wording of the question. They were able to pinpoint specific examples of corruption, such as Appius Claudius hearing the Verginia case himself or Tiberius' abuse of the treason trials. They compared Livy and Tacitus' presentations, noting that Livy explicitly decries the corruption of contemporary Rome in his preface and thus presents virtuous individuals of Rome's past, and Tacitus presents a Rome where the corrupt always win.",,42

Humanities,Classical Studies,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCECSERB,VCECS25EQB8,VCECSERBCM,,Question 8,ExaminerCommentary,"No students attempted this question. Students might have considered how Livy shows early Rome's hierarchy repeatedly shaken by arrogant nobles (Coriolanus, Verginia episode, Camillus) and defended by ideal figures like Cincinnatus. The plebians frequently challenge aristocratic power, exposing instability in the early republic. Tacitus portrays Augustus replacing the republican hierarchy with autocracy, and Tiberius preserving power through fear and treason trials. Germanicus' treatment shows how threats to imperial authority are eliminated.",,45
