Humanities,Texts and Traditions,Years 11 and 12,,VCETT12OVSC01,Scope of study,,Paragraph,"The study of VCE Texts and Traditions considers the place and meaning of sacred texts within their religious traditions. In an attempt to understand the intended meaning of the texts, the study focuses on the original contexts of sacred texts and examines their literary characteristics. The study currently encompasses texts from the Christian, Islamic and Jewish traditions. The main focus of the study is the texts that are seen to be foundational to the traditions being studied. These may be supplemented by texts from other traditions, commentaries, and later texts from the traditions beings studied.",,1
Humanities,Texts and Traditions,Years 11 and 12,,VCETT12OVSC02,Scope of study,,Paragraph,"A range of methods exists for interpreting sacred texts and exploring their intended meaning. VCE Texts and Traditions focuses on sociocultural, historical and literary methods of criticism. The process of searching for, and giving expression to, the meaning of sacred texts is called exegesis.",,2
Humanities,Texts and Traditions,Years 11 and 12,,VCETT12OVSC03,Scope of study,,Paragraph,"In this study, the term 'texts' refers to a body of writings held to be the authoritative core for the religious tradition, often referred to as scriptures. Additional writings that derive their authority from their relationship to the core can also be regarded as authoritative. For Units 3 and 4, the VCAA will publish a list of set texts annually. The term religious 'traditions' is understood to refer to established religious communities that continue to play an important part in creating, maintaining and shaping culture. Religious traditions contain ideas, values and beliefs about existence and the sacred and human experience that are expressed in a variety of ways.",,3
Humanities,Texts and Traditions,Years 11 and 12,,VCETT12OVRA01,Rationale,,Paragraph,The study of VCE Texts and Traditions equips students to come to a deeper understanding of the relationship between religious traditions and the written sacred texts that have grown from and shaped those traditions. Examining the sacred texts on which religious traditions are founded enables students to gain a good understanding of the basis of those traditions. These sacred texts become a touchstone of the tradition as it develops and responds to changing circumstances.,,1
Humanities,Texts and Traditions,Years 11 and 12,,VCETT12OVRA02,Rationale,,Paragraph,"Many religious traditions have a special relationship with a set of written texts, often referred to as sacred scriptures. Through this study, students are taught to understand that these written texts have particular authority for the tradition and may act as an important reference and foundation for the tradition's social organisation, rituals, values and beliefs, and for the behaviours of the tradition's followers, both historically and in the world today.",,2
Humanities,Texts and Traditions,Years 11 and 12,,VCETT12OVRA03,Rationale,,Paragraph,"Students study the sacred texts in their original social, cultural, religious, political and historical settings, as well as investigate the impact such texts have had throughout history and are having on the world today. Different methods of interpretation are taken into account throughout this study. Students also investigate the texts as pieces of literature and consider how others have been inspired by the interpretation of such writings. They develop the skills to be able to analyse these texts in the form of an exegesis.",,3
Humanities,Texts and Traditions,Years 11 and 12,,VCETT12OVRA04,Rationale,,Paragraph,"The study of VCE Texts and Traditions encourages independent and critical thinking in students that will assist them in work and study, and in fields that require critical thinking about, and research, analysis and interpretation of, written texts.",,4
