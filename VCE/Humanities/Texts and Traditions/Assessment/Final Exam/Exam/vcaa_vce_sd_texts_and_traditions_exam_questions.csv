'The word which came to Jeremiah from the LorD: ""Stand at the gate of the
House of the Lorp, and proclaim this word: Hear the word of the Lorb, all
you of Judah who enter these gates to worship the Lorp!
3Thus said the Lorp of Hosts, the God of Isracl: Mend your ways and your

Q a den of thieves? As for Me, I have been watching-declares the Lorp.
Just go to My place at Shiloh, where I had established My name formerly,
and see what I did to it because of the wickedness of My people Israel. BAnd
now, because you do all these things-declares the Lorb-and though I spoke
to you persistently, you would not listen; and though I called to you, you would
not respondfmtherefore will I do to the House which bears My name,
which you rely, and to the place which I gave you and your fathers, just what

Then it was that the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
3Thus said the Lorp, the God of Isracl: I made a covenant with your
fathers when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, the house of bondage,
saying: 14In the seventh year each of you must let go any fellow Hebrew who
may be sold to you; when he has served you six years, you must set him free.""
But your fathers would not obey Me or give ear. lsLat&:ly you turned about
and did what is proper in My sight, and each of you proclaimed a release to his
countrymen; and you made a covenant accordingly before Me in the House
which bears My name. 1°But now have you turned back and have profaned My
name; each of you has brought back the men and women whom you had given
their freedom, and forced them to be your slaves again.
'7Assuredly, thus said the Lorp: You would not obey Me and proclaim
release, each to his kinsman and countryman. Lo! I proclaim your release-
declares the Lorp-to the sword, to pestilence, and to famine; and I will
make you a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth. *I will make the men who
violated My covenant, who did not fulfill the terms of the covenant which they
made before Me, [like] the calf which they cut in two so as to pass between
the halves: ""The officers of Judah and Jerusalem, the of icials, the priests, and
all the people of the land who passed between the halves of the calf Pshall be :;'-
handed over to their enemies, to those who seek to kill them. Their carcasses
shall become food for the birds of the sky and the beasts of the earth.",,11

6The Lord said to me in the days of King Josiah: Have you seen what Rebel
Israel did, going to every high mountain and under every leafy tree, and whoring
there? 7I thought: After she has done all these things, she will come back to
Me. But she did not come back; and her sister, Faithless Judah, saw it. 8I noted:
Because Rebel Israel had committed adultery, I cast her off and handed her
bill of divorce; yet her sister, Faithless Judah, was not afraid-she too went
and whored. 9Indeed, the land was defiled by her casual immorality, as she
committed adultery with stone and with wood. 10And after all that, her sister,
Faithless Judah, did not return to Me wholeheartedly, but insincerely-declares
the Lord.
11And the Lord said to me: Rebel Israel has shown herself more in the right than
Faithless Judah. 12Go, make this proclamation toward the north, and say: Turn
back, O Rebel Israel-declares the Lord. I will not look on you in anger, for I am
compassionate-declares the Lord; I do not bear a grudge for all time. 13Only
recognize your sin; for you have transgressed against the Lord your God, and
scattered your favors among strangers under every leafy tree, and you have not
heeded Me-declares the Lord.
14Turn back, rebellious children-declares the Lord. Since I have espoused
you, I will take you, one from a town and two from a clan, and bring you to Zion.
15And I will give you shepherds after My own heart, who will pasture you with
knowledge and skill.

4Thus said the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, to the whole community which
I exiled from Jerusalem to Babylon: 5Build houses and live in them, plant
gardens and eat their fruit. 6Take wives and beget sons and daughters; and take
wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear
sons and daughters. Multiply there, do not decrease. 7And seek the welfare of
the city to which I have exiled you and pray to the Lord in its behalf; for in its
prosperity you shall prosper.

diviners in your midst deceive you, and pay no heed to the dreams they dream.

the Lord.

note of you, and I will fulfill to you My promise of favor-to bring you back to
this place. 11For I am mindful of the plans I have made concerning you-declares
the Lord-plans for your welfare, not for disaster, to give you a hopeful future.

will search for Me and find Me, if only you seek Me wholeheartedly. 14I will be
at hand for you-declares the Lord-and I will restore your fortunes. And I will
gather you from all the nations and from all the places to which I have banished

1The word of the Lord came to me: 2O mortal, prophesy against the shepherds
of Israel. Prophesy, and say to them:
To the shepherds: Thus said the Lord God: Ah, you shepherds of Israel, who
have been tending yourselves! Is it not the flock that the shepherds ought to
tend? 3You partake of the fat, you clothe yourselves with the wool, and you
slaughter the fatlings; but you do not tend the flock. 4You have not sustained the
weak, healed the sick, or bandaged the injured; you have not brought back the
strayed, or looked for the lost; but you have driven them with harsh rigor, 5and
they have been scattered for want of anyone to tend them; scattered, they have
become prey for every wild beast. 6My sheep stray through all the mountains
and over every lofty hill; My flock is scattered all over the face of the earth, with
none to take thought of them and none to seek them. 7Hear then, O shepherds,
the word of the Lord! 8As I live-declares the Lord God: Because My flock
has been a spoil-My flock has been a prey for all the wild beasts, for want of
anyone to tend them since My shepherds have not taken thought of My flock, for
the shepherds tended themselves instead of tending the flock-9hear indeed,
O shepherds, the word of the Lord: 10Thus said the Lord God: I am going to deal
with the shepherds! I will demand a reckoning of them for My flock, and I will
dismiss them from tending the flock. The shepherds shall not tend themselves
any more; for I will rescue My flock from their mouths, and it shall not be their
prey. 11For thus said the Lord God: Here am I! I am going to take thought for My
flock and I will seek them out.",,12
