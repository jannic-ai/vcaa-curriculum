Geographers are interested in key questions concerning places and geographic phenomena: What is there? Where is it? Why is it there? What are the effects of it being there? How is it changing over time? How could, and should, it change in the future? How is it different from other places and phenomena? How are places and phenomena connected?",,1

These methods underpin the development of a unique framework for understanding the world, enabling students to appreciate its complexity, the diversity and interactions of its environments, economies and cultures, and the processes that helped form and transform these.",,2

Each area of study utilises these concepts to assist in the observation, description, interpretation, analysis and explanation of geographic phenomena. VCE Geography is designed around two key concepts: change and interconnection, emphasising increasing human interaction with environments, which has had, and continues to have, significant consequences.",,3

In doing so, students develop a better understanding of their own place and its spaces and those in other parts of the world. These spatial perspectives, when integrated with historical, economic, ecological and cultural perspectives, deepen understanding of places and environments, and the human interactions with these.",,4

Investigative skills develop students' ability to conduct geographic study and inquiry including the collection of primary data through observation, surveys and fieldwork, and the collection of relevant secondary data and information. Interpretative and analytical skills enable students to interpret information presented in a variety of formats including maps, graphs, diagrams and images. These skills encourage students to critically evaluate information for its validity and reliability. Presentation and communication skills enable students to communicate their knowledge and understanding in a coherent, creative and effective manner, with the use of appropriate geographic terminology. The skills developed in investigation, collection of data, interpretation, analysis and communication of geographic information are enhanced through the use of geospatial technologies, both in the classroom and in the field. The geospatial industry is evolving and students with spatial skills continue to be in high demand, with the potential for a variety of career pathways.",,1

To receive a study score the student must achieve two or more graded assessments in the study and receive an S for both Units 3 and 4. The study score is reported on a scale of 0-50; it is a measure of how well the student performed in relation to all others who took the study. Teachers should refer to the current VCE Administrative Handbook for details on graded assessment and calculation of the study score.
