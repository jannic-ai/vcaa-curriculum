Humanities,Geography,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEGEER,,VCEGEERCM,,General Comments,ExaminerCommentary,"In the 2024 Geography examination, many students attempted the whole paper, with few questions left unanswered. Students were able to demonstrate sound geographic knowledge, with some providing well above standard responses throughout the examination.",,1
Humanities,Geography,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEGEER,,VCEGEERLR,LimitedStrategies,General Comments,ExaminerCommentary,"Responses generally showed a good level of geographic competency with appropriate use of geography-specific terminology. Most students utilised up-to-date case studies and statistics. Lower-scoring responses indicated generalisations, which were, at times, also out of date.",,2
Humanities,Geography,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEGEER,,VCEGEERER,EnhancedStrategies,General Comments,ExaminerCommentary,"Students should exercise discernment in selecting the most appropriate case study and data to use to respond to questions. Higher-scoring responses used data that added to the depth of their response; lower-scoring responses used data indiscriminately. The application of relevant data in a strategic way is a focus area for guiding students into higher achievement. Responses that included all the numbers that had been learnt indicated an inability to discern what the question is asking. In general, however, the case studies used by students in written responses were appropriate and on-topic. There was a significant reliance on textbook knowledge evident across all areas of assessment. This was particularly evident with the use of Greenland as a case study for Land Cover Change and either Bangladesh or Niger as the population case study for a growing population.",,3
Humanities,Geography,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEGEER,,VCEGEERCM,,General Comments,ExaminerCommentary,"There were a significant number of responses that were off-topic or demonstrated inadequate preparation, particularly in Questions 3 and 9, the two longer 10-mark questions. The use of the formulaic 'Pattern, Quantity and Exception' for Question 6 was not required and impacted negatively in some responses. Rigid application of this formula did not support focus on the changes between the two timeframes as the question required. Rote learning of responses, as was evident in some responses to Question 9 in particular, is not encouraged, as it does not support students to address the focus of questions asked in this examination. The application of key skills and key knowledge continues to be the focus of the examination.",,4
Humanities,Geography,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEGEER,,VCEGEERCM,,General Comments,ExaminerCommentary,"Students should ensure they understand the command/instructional terms. Of note in the 2024 examination, questions that directed students to 'analyse' or describe 'to what extent' required they make a determination of assessment, level of agreement or accuracy and explain this further in their response. The explanation as to the accuracy of their determination was the most important part of the response. This permitted a variation of finite decisions that could be made by students. Responses could either agree or disagree with a statement; it was the geographic reasoning that was being fully marked. Answers should have included underlying analysis, such as positive/negative, social/economic or short-/long-term understandings. It was not possible to fully respond to such questions without first making a determination and then supporting/analysing.",,5
Humanities,Geography,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEGEER,,VCEGEERCM,,General Comments,ExaminerCommentary,"In the Answer Book, lines are included beneath each question as an indication of the depth or length of the expected response; these do not account for variation in handwriting. Students are permitted - and encouraged - to use the extra writing space provided at the end of the Answer Book, if required. Students are to alert assessors should extra writing space be utilised in their responses. This was done well in 2024 by the majority of students. With more writing space included in the Answer Book this year, fewer students required supplementary booklets to complete their written responses.",,6

Humanities,Geography,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEGEER,VCEGE24EQ1,VCEGEERER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 1a,ExaminerCommentary,"General commentary such as 'deforestation is caused by logging' was insufficient on its own to achieve full marks as this is below the expected level of understanding for a Unit 3 student of Geography. An additional contextual explanation that 'deforestation is caused by logging to sell the timber for economic gain' would, however, earn the full two marks.",,15

There was no requirement for students to comment on the effectiveness of this assessment nor to explain each method of assessment in detail. Both methods of assessment selected by students needed to be specifically linked to the single case study / chosen location. High-scoring responses often referred to the scale of the two different assessment types, such as stating that the first method was a broad-scale assessment of deforestation, and the second a local scale. This was not required to achieve full marks but did distinguish stronger geographic responses from more generalised responses.",,20

Humanities,Geography,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEGEER,VCEGE24EQ2,VCEGEERCM,,Question 2,ExaminerCommentary,"Many responses to this question were generalised and did not address the issue of change over a defined time. This was seen, for example, in responses that stated simply that ice and glaciers had melted in the selected location. The use of accurate data to support the depth and elaboration of the scale of the melt were often absent in responses. Greenland was the most commonly selected location; other locations selected included Bolivia and Pakistan.",,28

Humanities,Geography,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEGEER,VCEGE24EQ2,VCEGEERCM,,Question 2,ExaminerCommentary,"Some responses provided detail about the Holocene period and its three main timeframes. This was not required and, on its own, often an insufficient response. If used as the basis to show that change has occurred over many timescales, however, this could be used to lay the basis for the current depth and elaboration of the melting ice scale of change over a defined period of time.",,34
Humanities,Geography,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEGEER,VCEGE24EQ2,VCEGEERER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 2,StudentResponse,The following is an example of a high-scoring response:,In Greenland a defined period of time in which icemelt was significant was between January 2019 and December 2019. For this period a total of 600 billion tons of ice was melted in Greenland. Greenland showing the large scale loss of ice for that period. In Greenland furthermore 92% of Greenland's total ice,35

Humanities,Geography,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEGEER,VCEGE24EQ3,VCEGEERCM,,Question 3,ExaminerCommentary,"This longer response required students to include more than one natural process, and at least one human activity. The focus of this question was the interconnection between these two components - human and natural. Responses that did not include this aspect were not able to achieve greater than six marks; this occurred in a significant number of responses. Many students were able to write about climate change as a human activity, but the geographic discussion in responses sometimes lacked detail and development. Some responses about climate change as both a human activity and as a natural process struggled for clarity. Common inaccuracies in responses included description of the albedo effect and the ozone layer, how they function, and the role they play in contributing to global warming.",,37

Humanities,Geography,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEGEER,VCEGE24EQ3,VCEGEERCM,,Question 3,ExaminerCommentary,"All students are encouraged to read the entire question when formulating their response, rather than focusing on keywords that do not cover all aspects of the question.",,46
Humanities,Geography,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEGEER,VCEGE24EQ3,VCEGEERER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 3,StudentResponse,The following is an example of a high-scoring response:,"The Natural process of decreasing albedo of Greenland's ice sheet is contributing to its ice melt. Ash from volcanism, dust from deserts for around the globe as well as other impurities are blown onto Greenland's ice sheet making it darker, making is absorb more radiation from the sun and more ice melt. These impurities called cryoconite which gather on the ice's surface and form clusters of accelerated ice melt. This natural process that decreases Greenland's ice albedo has a strong interconnection with the human activity of fossil fuel combustion, primarily in Europe through coal-fired power stations. This human activity releases soot into the atmosphere which is blown onto Greenland's ice sheet by strong trade winds. The vast quantities of fossil fuel that has been combusted since the industrial revolution has resulted in approximately 1.9˚C of warming on average globally, due to the enhanced greenhouse effect. Thus, large quantities of soot reach Greenland. This accumulates on the ice surface and is covered by snow fall. Future melting uncovers these impurities which decreases the ice's albedo further, contributing to ice melt. Recently it was determined that the average surface temperature in Greenland has increased by 2.8˚C. Thus, a significant signpost to the contribution continuing albedo from both natural and human source has on ice melt in Greenland.",47
Humanities,Geography,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEGEER,VCEGE24EQ4,VCEGEERER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 4a,ExaminerCommentary,"Students were required to write about satellite images or remote sensing; the majority completed this accurately. A few students mistakenly wrote about the photographic images in the Data Book provided in the examination. High-scoring responses identified how the technology would be used, such as relating to change over time, by writing, for example, 'from one year to the next' or 'before and after work on this land use change has occurred'. Students were to detail an example, such as comparing the previous width of a street with the possible new width. Students were also expected to discuss the merit of such images, such as their reliability or clarity in assisting the identification of land use change.",,48
Humanities,Geography,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEGEER,VCEGE24EQ4,VCEGEERER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 4a,StudentResponse,The following is an example of a high-scoring response:,"In order to identify land use change in Varanasi, India, the analysis of satellite images could provide the process and scale of change on a spatial (size of region affected) and temporal (comparison of images from 2000 to 2024) distribution. By comparing satellite images from different years, the geographer could analyse the bird's-eye view image of the area and geographic characteristics that may indicate likely land use change. For example, comparing the number of motor vehicles would imply a change from semi-residential to transport land use increases.",49
Humanities,Geography,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEGEER,VCEGE24EQ4,VCEGEERER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 4b,ExaminerCommentary,"High-scoring responses to this question stated the geographic technique utilised and explained why this would be a good data source. Well-scoring responses included the use of 'surveys of the local population' or 'the use of photographs as in the data book' to determine the local impact of the change in land use to inform the geographer. Excellent responses referred to the difference in the local scale of this information as opposed to the wider information collected in Question 4a. Some responses mistakenly referred to a 'secondary response' instead of a 'second response', which is a primary data collection form not a secondary data collection form. No marks were awarded for answers that mentioned the use of satellite images or other forms of remote sensing; the question explicitly stated these were not to be included, but the statistics suggest this was a common error. Students are reminded to read the entire question carefully.",,50
Humanities,Geography,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEGEER,VCEGE24EQ4,VCEGEERER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 4b,StudentResponse,The following is an example of a high-scoring response:,"Another source of data that the geographer could use in an investigation of the change in land use at Varanasi is data created via interviews. This can help to attain knowledge on how long the change took, its impact on residents, the ways the change happened and much more. This data is valuable as it is primary data that comes straight from the source and also considers individual perspectives which many other types of data do not.",51
Humanities,Geography,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEGEER,VCEGE24EQ4,VCEGEERCM,,Question 4c,ExaminerCommentary,"Students were required to elaborate on a geospatial technique, providing its name and a description of its use. To fully answer this question, responses needed to describe the context of use of the geospatial technique at students' specific fieldwork site and the land use change under review. Responses at times did not refer to the fieldwork site nor include any indication of the land use before and after change. While not explicitly stated in the question, and therefore not required for marks, it was nevertheless more difficult for responses to describe the use of the geospatial technique in fieldwork without stating the land use change at a given location.",,52
Humanities,Geography,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEGEER,VCEGE24EQ4,VCEGEERCM,,Question 4c,ExaminerCommentary,"A maximum of two marks were awarded if the technique described in the response was not a geospatial technique accompanied by a clear link to their specific fieldwork site.

Humanities,Geography,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEGEER,VCEGE24EQ4,VCEGEERER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 4c,StudentResponse,The following is an example of a high-scoring response:,"One geospatial technology used at my fieldwork investigation about the impacts of industrial to mixed use residential land use change at Altona North Precinct 15 was a geotagged Survey 123 traffic count. I conducted a traffic count along the southern boarder of the precinct, which was Blackshaws Road. These results were then uploaded along with a location pin by Survey 123, where they were placed on a GIS map with other people traffic count.

Humanities,Geography,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEGEER,VCEGE24EQ5,VCEGEERCM,,Question 5,ExaminerCommentary,"All students who attempted this question were successfully able to identify an ageing population. Most common case studies were Germany and Japan; some students also wrote about Australia. Most students were able to state one demographic characteristic, and often stated two for a full response. The use of these characteristics to then classify the country as 'ageing' was less successfully completed. The use of accurate data such as the elderly dependency ratio was a sound choice of demographic characteristic to include; however, an explanation of the support that this number gave to the country's being classified as 'ageing' was often omitted or not explained well. A number of responses provided two demographic characteristics, but gave an explanation of how this contributes to the ageing classification for only one. Low-scoring responses included generalities, such as identifying the number of people above the age of 65 as a demographic characteristic and explaining this characteristic as having many older people.",,56

Two reasons were required; one reason could only receive a maximum of half the available marks. Explanations needed to go beyond a description of the wide base and the 'bottom heavy' nature of the population structure. Responses could have included the high crude birth rate, higher than the 2.1 replacement rate; or a falling infant mortality rate alongside a persistently high crude birth rate; some answers could be partly descriptive. Country A's position on the Demographic Transition Model - that is, late Stage 1 or early Stage 2 - could also have been used to explain the significant number of the population below 19 years of age. Social and economic reasons such as the need for rural labour, old-age security and replacement rates could be given. Religion was not an acceptable reason, unless it was specific to a country or society.",,62
Humanities,Geography,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEGEER,VCEGE24EQ7,VCEGEERER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 7a,StudentResponse,The following is an example of a high-scoring response:,"One cultural factor potentially contributing to the high youth dependency ratio exhibited in Country A, Figure 3 is cultural norms around women's role as homemakers and childbirthers. This would contribute to the high proportion of youth by increasing the fertility window of women as well as their desire to have kids, thus increasing birth rates and youth dependency. One social factor could be reduced access to contraception. Countries where less funding and resources are put into the provision of reproductive services will thus have less means to reduce birth rates, contributing to high youth dependency.",63
Humanities,Geography,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEGEER,VCEGE24EQ7,VCEGEERLR,LimitedStrategies,Question 7b,ExaminerCommentary,Many responses did not fully answer this question. Most were able to provide a basic statement that life expectancy will increase. Responses were expected to use data from Figure 3 and include specific reference to Country A. The link between the infant mortality rate and the need for replacement children to support the family and older family members was commonly explored; the link between better health resources/access resulting in a lower infant mortality rate and improving life expectancy was also explained well. The nature of the changing impact over decades was less frequently addressed; clear responses that did address this part of the question may have included some reference to moving from Stage 2 to Stage 3 of the Demographic Transition Model and the consequence of this for the life expectancy of Country A.,,64

High-scoring responses commented on the population momentum and a resulting increased longevity due to improved life chances, with respect to health and economic prosperity, and higher rates of child survival. These responses also commented that such changes were accompanied by decreased births, meaning lower maternal death rates and thus an increased life expectancy rate.",,65

His theory also predicted that variations in population growth would occur from two main causes, positive and preventative ""checks"". Positive checks and natural variations which keep population growth in check, such as disease or famine, resulting in higher death rates which reduce population.

This project involved the initial construction of the first GRACE satellite in 2017 and the consequent second satellite being constructed in May 2018. These satellites hover over 500 km above ground level and can provide precise data on the recent melting of Greenland's MGIS. These satellites utilise the volume and density of the air in order to explicitly collect data on where MGIS is occurring and to what extent they are melting. The satellites collected data on one of Greenland's biggest glaciers, the Jakobshaven glacier, where in 2019 600 billion tonnes of ice melted contributing to approximately a 0.8mm sea level rise. The satellites have also calculated that overall 27 gigatons of ice have melted within Greenland, which could cause sea levels to rise by up to 2.2mm approximately. Furthermore, the satellites are an extremely efficient way for the Greenland and surrounding governments such as the Danish government to assess rates of MGIS through explicit understanding of where MGIS is occurring within Greenland and by how much. This can lead to effective management by government as data collected by the satellites have raised awareness for the implementation and severity revolved around the MGIS in Greenland. In response the Greenland government has implemented responses such as the Hydropower Plant Project in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from diesel powered electricity and instead increase the usage of green, sustainable and clean energy in the town of Ilulissat, Greenland. Contributing to lowered carbon dioxide emissions which can lower the enhanced greenhouse effect, in an attempt to restrict MGIS from occurring. These satellites are financially sustainable due to the fact that as much as they were expensive to implement (costing up to $270million US), data collected has driven awareness within Greenland for MGIS, contributing to socially sustainable responses being made by governments and citizens. Overall the long term positives of the satellites outweigh the initial high set up costs, and other potential restrictions such as satellite inability to functions adequately during extreme weather events. Evidently showing that this geo-spatial technology has done more than ""little"" to effectively assess and managed MGIS in Greenland and is overall quite an effective response.",36

The rate of growth may be continuing or be impacted by government and NGO plans and policies. This is evident as the country is moving through the population structures that are typical of the Demographic Transition Model stages. A variety of sketches would be considered acceptable. The validity of these sketches is the core factor. Examples of sketch diagrams could include age gender structures or positions on the DTM.,,54

Humanities,Geography,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEGEER,VCEGE25EQ9,VCEGEERER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 9,StudentResponse,,"During 1990s, Tanzania had a high fertility rate of 5.03 and high growth rate of 3.05%. This resulted in a large youthful population, as seen in figure c, and a small elderly population thus placing Tanzania in stage 2 of the Demographic Transition Model (DTM), as seen in figure B. This can be attributed to low female literacy rates at 48% leading to low education surrounding contraception and therefore high fertility rates, evident as 40% of girls aged 15-19 with no education had a child, compared to 6% of those with secondary education. This can also be attributed to high levels of poverty, with 26.4% below the poverty line, leading to high levels of subsistence agriculture and kids seen as an economic asset, leading to high fertility.",56
Humanities,Geography,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEGEER,VCEGE25EQ9,VCEGEERER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 9,StudentResponse,,"During 2025, both the fertility rate and growth rate have decreased significantly, at 4.5 and 2.9% respectively. This has resulted in a smaller, youthful population, although still large with 42% below 15 and a larger elderly population placing Tanzania in late stage 2/early stage 3 of the DTM as seen in figure B. This can be attributed to decreasing infant mortality rates, at 57/1000 live births reducing the need for replacement children as well as increased contraception rising from 27% in 2017 to 31.7% in 2025 and unmet need for contraception decreasing from 50% in 2017 to 22% in 2025.",57
Humanities,Geography,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEGEER,VCEGE25EQ9,VCEGEERER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 9,StudentResponse,,"As Tanzanians general population trend is a decreasing fertility rate and increasing life expectancy, Tanzania is likely to enter a demographic dividend in the future as seen by the population structure in figure D. This is because lower fertility rates mean there is a smaller proportion of youthful dependents to care for. However high fertility rates in the past means there is a large working class, thus resulting in economic growth for the country.",58
Humanities,Geography,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEGEER,VCEGE25EQ9,VCEGEERCM,,Question 9,ExaminerCommentary,"Students sketched a wide range of diagrams, including population structure diagrams, maps of the country and population over time. Students were generally able to discuss what was currently happening with the population but some did not analyse the change over time or how the change may impact the country into the future. Some students used a prepared response that did not answer the question, and therefore did not enable them to achieve marks. Some students drew detailed sketches but did not refer to them or annotate them, so it was not clear what the diagrams were showing. A wide range of countries were chosen, including Chad, Kenya, Tanzania, South Sudan, Saudi Arabia and Madagascar, with the majority of students choosing either Bangladesh or Niger.",,59

Humanities,Geography,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEGEER,VCEGE25EQ10,VCEGEERER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 10c,StudentResponse,The following is an example of a high-scoring response for Germany:,"The response implemented by BMW has seen a high level of effectiveness in targeting the declining working age sector. They implement over 70 amendments, which totalled just $64,000 euros, thus denoting the economically viable outcomes. These amendments included the introduction of weight adapted footwear and wooden floors which reduce the knee pain and strain on their workers, thus removing the potentiality of retirement through injury. Further, they introduced more frequent workstation changes as well as ""barber style"" work chairs, which reduces strain on one part of the body within an entire days work, as well as ensuring adequate and sufficient rest within breaks. Their success has been outlined through quantifiable evidence, whereby in 2020 50% of Dinggolfingsc (town in Germany) workers were above the age of 50. Alongside this, their review of the strategy has seen a 5% reduction in absenteeism and an increase in productivity by 7%. Through conducted surveys, it was outlined that this is likely due to their enjoyment in work and great fullness towards the ability to keep working through old age. This highlights the effectiveness as it reduces the pressure among the government agencies and the pension system, as more individuals remain paying taxes. As the way Germany's current pension system works is the money is immediately collected and distributed among retirees. As a result, 85% of the pensioners income is state financed, which pressures the government seeing an additional $154billion required in 2021 to meet the owed incomes. Thus the BMW response is actively reducing these perceived issues. However, it is not a long term response as eventually total fertility rates must be targeted and advanced. Overall, the BMW response targets the reduced working age sector and reduces pressure on the German government.",63

Responses for Germany also referred to examples used by populist politicians rather than data, particularly around unemployment, racism, crime, etc. Japanese examples use Angel Plan, Abenomics and robots, but these were often superficial. Students should choose a country with sufficient current and accurate policies/data. Many of the strategies implemented are now over 20 years old, which allows for evaluation but not many current approaches.",,66

They should look for multi-part questions to ensure it is possible to respond to all parts with a linking response. Students should be very careful not to contradict themselves (i.e. in responses for questions 2a/2b and 10a/10b). Students would benefit from taking a moment to plan their long-answer responses, so they do not repeat themselves too much and effectively use the writing space provided with specifics. In this examination, students were able to show that they knew their case studies and had data to support their statements.",,67
