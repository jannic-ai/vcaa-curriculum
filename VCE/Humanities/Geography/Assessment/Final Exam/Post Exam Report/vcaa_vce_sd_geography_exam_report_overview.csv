Humanities,Geography,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEGEER,VCEGEERGC,General Comments,,"In the 2024 Geography examination, many students attempted the whole paper, with few questions left unanswered. Students were able to demonstrate sound geographic knowledge, with some providing well above standard responses throughout the examination.",,1
Humanities,Geography,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEGEER,VCEGEERGC,General Comments,,"Responses generally showed a good level of geographic competency with appropriate use of geography-specific terminology. Most students utilised up-to-date case studies and statistics. Lower-scoring responses indicated generalisations, which were, at times, also out of date.",,2
Humanities,Geography,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEGEER,VCEGEERGC,General Comments,,"Students should exercise discernment in selecting the most appropriate case study and data to use to respond to questions. Higher-scoring responses used data that added to the depth of their response; lower-scoring responses used data indiscriminately. The application of relevant data in a strategic way is a focus area for guiding students into higher achievement. Responses that included all the numbers that had been learnt indicated an inability to discern what the question is asking. In general, however, the case studies used by students in written responses were appropriate and on-topic. There was a significant reliance on textbook knowledge evident across all areas of assessment. This was particularly evident with the use of Greenland as a case study for Land Cover Change and either Bangladesh or Niger as the population case study for a growing population.",,3
Humanities,Geography,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEGEER,VCEGEERGC,General Comments,,"There were a significant number of responses that were off-topic or demonstrated inadequate preparation, particularly in Questions 3 and 9, the two longer 10-mark questions. The use of the formulaic 'Pattern, Quantity and Exception' for Question 6 was not required and impacted negatively in some responses. Rigid application of this formula did not support focus on the changes between the two timeframes as the question required. Rote learning of responses, as was evident in some responses to Question 9 in particular, is not encouraged, as it does not support students to address the focus of questions asked in this examination. The application of key skills and key knowledge continues to be the focus of the examination.",,4
Humanities,Geography,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEGEER,VCEGEERGC,General Comments,,"Students should ensure they understand the command/instructional terms. Of note in the 2024 examination, questions that directed students to 'analyse' or describe 'to what extent' required they make a determination of assessment, level of agreement or accuracy and explain this further in their response. The explanation as to the accuracy of their determination was the most important part of the response. This permitted a variation of finite decisions that could be made by students. Responses could either agree or disagree with a statement; it was the geographic reasoning that was being fully marked. Answers should have included underlying analysis, such as positive/negative, social/economic or short-/long-term understandings. It was not possible to fully respond to such questions without first making a determination and then supporting/analysing.",,5
Humanities,Geography,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEGEER,VCEGEERGC,General Comments,,"In the Answer Book, lines are included beneath each question as an indication of the depth or length of the expected response; these do not account for variation in handwriting. Students are permitted - and encouraged - to use the extra writing space provided at the end of the Answer Book, if required. Students are to alert assessors should extra writing space be utilised in their responses. This was done well in 2024 by the majority of students. With more writing space included in the Answer Book this year, fewer students required supplementary booklets to complete their written responses.",,6

Humanities,Geography,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEGEER,VCEGEERGC,General Comments,,"A major issue arising from the loss of livelihood security is the loss of secure land rights for indigenous communities. Although many communities rely on forests for cultural identity and forest resources, ~40% of Indigenous land claims in Borneo are legally recognised. The associated challenge is that plantation concessions frequently overlap with customary land with over 55% of new concessions since the 2010s have been granted on indigenous territories. This makes it extremely difficult for communities to contest land grabs or seek compensation, leading to ongoing poverty with rates reaching up to 30% in forest fringe areas and loss of cultural practices and a continued conflict with palm oil companies.",,25
Humanities,Geography,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEGEER,VCEGEERGC,General Comments,,"Responses covered a wide range of case studies including Borneo, Cameroon, the Amazon, Sumatra, PNG, Central Victoria, Tanzania, Tasmania, the Philippines, Madagascar and Ghana. Students demonstrated a good knowledge of their case study for deforestation and an understanding of environmental and social impacts. Many students used case-study-specific data to support their discussion, such as the number of gorillas or orangutans left in the wild, or the specifics of the Baku people. There was an evident and clear understanding from many students about the difference between an issue and a challenge. Higher-scoring responses were awarded marks according to their choice of issue and data relating to the challenge. Students are encouraged to use time-management skills to answer the question; general context for the case study was not required.",,26
Humanities,Geography,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEGEER,VCEGEERGC,General Comments,,Students were required to use grassland and coniferous forest data to show there are both similarities and differences in the locations across the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Accurate and relevant quantification would lift the quality of the answers.,,27
Humanities,Geography,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEGEER,VCEGEERGC,General Comments,,"Overall, this question was well done, and most students were able to describe the data effectively.

Humanities,Geography,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEGEER,VCEGEERGC,General Comments,,"Both the distribution of grassland and coniferous forest is located predominantly in the northern hemisphere evident as grassland is distributed from 90-5N latitude and only slightly in the southern hemisphere from 0-45S latitude. This is similar to coniferous forests, distributed from 80-5N latitude and only slightly in the southern hemisphere from 0-50S latitude. However grassland covers a significantly larger area of vegetation compared to coniferous forests. This is evident as grassland reaches a distribution of 340 km2 at 50-45N compared to coniferous forests which reaches a maximum of 75 km2 at 40-35N.",,30

Humanities,Geography,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEGEER,VCEGEERGC,General Comments,,"In Ilulissat, Greenland, the two GRACE Satellites have to some extent assisted in effectively assessing and managing rates of melting glaciers and ice sheets (MGIS) nationally. This project involved the initial construction of the first GRACE satellite in 2017 and the consequent second satellite being constructed in May 2018. These satellites hover over 500 km above ground level and can provide precise data on the recent melting of Greenland's MGIS. These satellites utilise the volume and density of the air in order to explicitly collect data on where MGIS is occurring and to what extent they are melting. The satellites collected data on one of Greenland's biggest glaciers, the Jakobshaven glacier, where in 2019 600 billion tonnes of ice melted contributing to approximately a 0.8mm sea level rise. The satellites have also calculated that overall 27 gigatons of ice have melted within Greenland, which could cause sea levels to rise by up to 2.2mm approximately. Furthermore, the satellites are an extremely efficient way for the Greenland and surrounding governments such as the Danish government to assess rates of MGIS through explicit understanding of where MGIS is occurring within Greenland and by how much. This can lead to effective management by government as data collected by the satellites have raised awareness for the implementation and severity revolved around the MGIS in Greenland. In response the Greenland government has implemented responses such as the Hydropower Plant Project in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from diesel powered electricity and instead increase the usage of green, sustainable and clean energy in the town of Ilulissat, Greenland. Contributing to lowered carbon dioxide emissions which can lower the enhanced greenhouse effect, in an attempt to restrict MGIS from occurring. These satellites are financially sustainable due to the fact that as much as they were expensive to implement (costing up to $270million US), data collected has driven awareness within Greenland for MGIS, contributing to socially sustainable responses being made by governments and citizens. Overall the long term positives of the satellites outweigh the initial high set up costs, and other potential restrictions such as satellite inability to functions adequately during extreme weather events. Evidently showing that this geo-spatial technology has done more than ""little"" to effectively assess and managed MGIS in Greenland and is overall quite an effective response.",,41

Humanities,Geography,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEGEER,VCEGEERGC,General Comments,,"Geographic characteristics can be human or natural, though students were not required to identify these with this terminology. Two geographic characteristics - such as location, scale, topography, regional setting, infrastructure of the site or demographic characteristics - needed to be identified. Possible responses could include proximity to other local features making it ideal to develop (e.g. near a train station so greater access for patrons/residents) or demand in the local area (e.g. no other primary school around and there is a population bulge in this age group). Students needed to identify how each of these characteristics resulted in this location being changed from one land use to the next.

Humanities,Geography,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEGEER,VCEGEERGC,General Comments,,"A geographic characteristic that likely impacted the land use change of the Hawthorn Grove Estate is the human geographic characteristic of close proximity to schools. The Hawthorn Grove Estate is directly opposite the school Xavier College, 400 metres from MLC and 1km from Glenferrie Primary School. This makes the location a desirable spot for families to live, influencing the change from commercial to residential. Another human geographic characteristic that likely influenced the land use change of the Hawthorn Grove Estate is its close proximity to the city. The land is approximately 6km East of Melbourne's CBD, which make the location a desirable spot for home buyers. This is because, being so close to the CBD means transport is more accessible and is closer to a wider array of services, such as food and hospitality.",,48

This can be attributed to low female literacy rates at 48% leading to low education surrounding contraception and therefore high fertility rates, evident as 40% of girls aged 15-19 with no education had a child, compared to 6% of those with secondary education. This can also be attributed to high levels of poverty, with 26.4% below the poverty line, leading to high levels of subsistence agriculture and kids seen as an economic asset, leading to high fertility.",,66

This has resulted in a smaller, youthful population, although still large with 42% below 15 and a larger elderly population placing Tanzania in late stage 2/early stage 3 of the DTM as seen in figure B. This can be attributed to decreasing infant mortality rates, at 57/1000 live births reducing the need for replacement children as well as increased contraception rising from 27% in 2017 to 31.7% in 2025 and unmet need for contraception decreasing from 50% in 2017 to 22% in 2025.",,67
Humanities,Geography,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEGEER,VCEGEERGC,General Comments,,"As Tanzanians general population trend is a decreasing fertility rate and increasing life expectancy, Tanzania is likely to enter a demographic dividend in the future as seen by the population structure in figure D. This is because lower fertility rates mean there is a smaller proportion of youthful dependents to care for. However high fertility rates in the past means there is a large working class, thus resulting in economic growth for the country.",,68
Humanities,Geography,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEGEER,VCEGEERGC,General Comments,,"Students sketched a wide range of diagrams, including population structure diagrams, maps of the country and population over time. Students were generally able to discuss what was currently happening with the population but some did not analyse the change over time or how the change may impact the country into the future. Some students used a prepared response that did not answer the question, and therefore did not enable them to achieve marks. Some students drew detailed sketches but did not refer to them or annotate them, so it was not clear what the diagrams were showing. A wide range of countries were chosen, including Chad, Kenya, Tanzania, South Sudan, Saudi Arabia and Madagascar, with the majority of students choosing either Bangladesh or Niger.",,69

Humanities,Geography,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEGEER,VCEGEERGC,General Comments,,Students needed to link this answer to their answer for part a. The strategy selected needed to be named and its main aims given.,,71
Humanities,Geography,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEGEER,VCEGEERGC,General Comments,,"Students needed to discuss the strategy identified in part b. Outcomes of this strategy were to be clearly identified as being positive or negative to resolve the demographic issue being faced at this location. Students were required to use evidence to support the discussion on environmental, social, economic and cultural impacts, as the question asked for an evaluation of the strategy.",,72
Humanities,Geography,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEGEER,VCEGEERGC,General Comments,,The following is an example of a high-scoring response for Germany:,,73
Humanities,Geography,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEGEER,VCEGEERGC,General Comments,,"The response implemented by BMW has seen a high level of effectiveness in targeting the declining working age sector. They implement over 70 amendments, which totalled just $64,000 euros, thus denoting the economically viable outcomes. These amendments included the introduction of weight adapted footwear and wooden floors which reduce the knee pain and strain on their workers, thus removing the potentiality of retirement through injury. Further, they introduced more frequent workstation changes as well as ""barber style"" work chairs, which reduces strain on one part of the body within an entire days work, as well as ensuring adequate and sufficient rest within breaks. Their success has been outlined through quantifiable evidence, whereby in 2020 50% of Dinggolfingsc (town in Germany) workers were above the age of 50. Alongside this, their review of the strategy has seen a 5% reduction in absenteeism and an increase in productivity by 7%. Through conducted surveys, it was outlined that this is likely due to their enjoyment in work and great fullness towards the ability to keep working through old age. This highlights the effectiveness as it reduces the pressure among the government agencies and the pension system, as more individuals remain paying taxes. As the way Germany's current pension system works is the money is immediately collected and distributed among retirees. As a result, 85% of the pensioners income is state financed, which pressures the government seeing an additional $154billion required in 2021 to meet the owed incomes. Thus the BMW response is actively reducing these perceived issues. However, it is not a long term response as eventually total fertility rates must be targeted and advanced. Overall, the BMW response targets the reduced working age sector and reduces pressure on the German government.",,74
Humanities,Geography,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEGEER,VCEGEERGC,General Comments,,Students needed to use reading time to plan this response as all three parts of this question were linked. Information provided in part a. needed to allow students to respond to the next two parts of Question 10. High-scoring responses were able to link the students' strategies directly to the issue and to the idea of an ageing population.,,75
Humanities,Geography,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEGEER,VCEGEERGC,General Comments,,"Students worked on a wide range of case studies: Australia, Japan and Germany were some of the most popular, and Italy, Spain, China, Portugal, Romania, Finland, South Korea and Singapore were also included.",,76
Humanities,Geography,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEGEER,VCEGEERGC,General Comments,,"The strategy for Germany was often open-door policy, but this was too vague and inaccurate. Responses for Germany also referred to examples used by populist politicians rather than data, particularly around unemployment, racism, crime, etc. Japanese examples use Angel Plan, Abenomics and robots, but these were often superficial. Students should choose a country with sufficient current and accurate policies/data. Many of the strategies implemented are now over 20 years old, which allows for evaluation but not many current approaches.",,77
Humanities,Geography,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEGEER,VCEGEERGC,General Comments,,"Generally, students should use the reading time to read over the questions and determine the structure and complexity required for the long-response questions. They should look for multi-part questions to ensure it is possible to respond to all parts with a linking response. Students should be very careful not to contradict themselves (i.e. in responses for questions 2a/2b and 10a/10b). Students would benefit from taking a moment to plan their long-answer responses, so they do not repeat themselves too much and effectively use the writing space provided with specifics. In this examination, students were able to show that they knew their case studies and had data to support their statements.",,78
