Humanities,Politics,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEPOERA,VCEPO25EQA1,VCEPOERAER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 1,ExaminerCommentary,"Students were required to identify two clear and distinct causes of their chosen global issue. When describing the cause, high-scoring responses referred to specific evidence or examples that highlighted the presence of this cause.",,1

Humanities,Politics,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEPOERA,VCEPO25EQA1,VCEPOERACM,,Question 1,ExaminerCommentary,"For example, excess CO2 in the atmosphere was accepted as one key cause of climate change, and resource exploitation was accepted as a second cause, even though it results in increased CO2 in the atmosphere. The way the student described the cause, and the evidence used in support, could help them achieve higher marks.",,4
Humanities,Politics,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEPOERA,VCEPO25EQA2,VCEPOERACM,,Question 2,ExaminerCommentary,"Students generally handled this question well. Successful responses ensured the name of their international law was clear, correct and in full. No marks were given if they simply gave an acronym for an international law. The explanation of international law outlined in the study design is broad in its scope.",,5
Humanities,Politics,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEPOERA,VCEPO25EQA3,VCEPOERACM,,Question 3,ExaminerCommentary,"This question asked students to directly engage with a specific characteristic from the study design. If students chose to engage with both stability and change, their response was assessed on the concept they mentioned first.",,6
Humanities,Politics,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEPOERA,VCEPO25EQA3,VCEPOERAER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 3,ExaminerCommentary,"There was a tendency for students to refer to political instability, which blended the concepts of stability and change, meaning that the response may have been less clear. Strong responses tended to signpost their understanding of either stability or change early in the piece and use definitive evidence to either indicate stability (status quo) or change. Importantly, it was not necessary for students to evaluate whether stability or change are good or bad. They were required only to assess the existence of either, through evidence from their chosen case study. A common limitation in responses was to suggest there had been either stability or change but providing no evidence to support that claim.",,7
Humanities,Politics,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEPOERA,VCEPO25EQA4,VCEPOERAER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 4,ExaminerCommentary,"This question appeared to challenge many students. Higher-scoring responses were able to articulate a clear understanding of what global interconnectedness is, and then used examples that demonstrated this understanding. For example, some responses described global interconnectedness as the growing relationships and interactions among states and cultures, largely driven by advancements in technology, trade and communication. Based on this definition, students may have used examples such as:",,8

Humanities,Politics,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEPOERA,VCEPO25EQA4,VCEPOERAER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 4,ExaminerCommentary,"Importantly, once the student had been able to identify examples of interconnectedness, the question required that they engage in a discussion about impact. Higher-scoring responses were able to present a balanced discussion, outlining strengths and weaknesses or points for or against (in line with the 'discuss' command term) the impact of global interconnectedness on the chosen issue. This was vital for students to be able to access the higher score range, and these responses were able to show that interconnectedness can make an impact in diverse and often contrary ways.",,13
Humanities,Politics,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEPOERA,VCEPO25EQA4,VCEPOERAER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 4,StudentResponse,The following is an example of a high-scoring response:,"Whilst global interconnectedness has led to the increase in the capacity of states and global actors to work collaboratively to combat climate change through diplomacy, it has also negatively impacted the resolution of the global issue due to increased demand for fossil fuels compromising the [movement] to resolve climate change.",14
Humanities,Politics,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEPOERA,VCEPO25EQA4,VCEPOERAER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 4,StudentResponse,,"Indeed, global interconnectedness has led to the facilitation of more diplomacy between states to work collaboratively to find resolutions to climate change, with the advancements in technology, communication and the more interdependent nature of the world leading to more than 54,000 delegates from 200 states being present at the 2024 Conference of Parties (COP) 29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, and the use of negotiation between the parties to increase climate finance for developing Non-Annexe countries from $100 billion USD to $300 billion, demonstrating how the increasingly interconnected nature of the world has made it easier to cooperate, positively impacting the resolution of climate change and efforts to combat the issue.",15
Humanities,Politics,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEPOERA,VCEPO25EQA4,VCEPOERAER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 4,StudentResponse,,"Contrastingly, global interconnectedness has also negatively impacted and hindered the resolution of climate change by exacerbating its causes: the burning of fossil fuels, principally. This can be seen through the increasing global demand for fossil fuels and coal due to advances in technology and trade, with Australia exporting $127.4 billion worth of coal in 2022/2023, leading to a further accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and the exacerbation of the greenhouse effect, warming the planet. This has therefore challenged the resolution of climate change and the goals of international accords such as the Paris Agreement seeking net-zero by 2050 by proliferating its causes.",16
Humanities,Politics,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEPOERA,VCEPO25EQA5,VCEPOERAER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 5,ExaminerCommentary,"This question required students to identify a specific consequence resulting from their chosen contemporary crisis. Students are reminded that consequences are distinct from causes and are usually 'effects' of either the crisis itself or of the actors' responses to the crisis. To receive full marks, students needed to make their specific consequence clear and then provide evidence of that consequence in practice. Responses that generalised about the consequence they identified did not receive full marks. Specificity of evidence in support of the consequence was a hallmark of higher-scoring responses.",,17
Humanities,Politics,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEPOERA,VCEPO25EQA6,VCEPOERAER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 6,ExaminerCommentary,"Responses for this question generally indicated an understanding of diplomatic processes.

Humanities,Politics,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEPOERA,VCEPO25EQA6,VCEPOERACM,,Question 6,ExaminerCommentary,"Once an example of diplomacy was identified, students were required to provide detail and context for how this had been used to attempt to resolve the crisis. It was acceptable for students to choose examples that had not resolved the crisis or to discuss diplomacy that only dealt with certain aspects of the crisis. Furthermore, some aspects of diplomacy may partly resolve the crisis but to the detriment of other actors, which was also an acceptable approach to the discussion. For higher marks to be awarded, it was crucial that students avoided generalising about the process of diplomacy and followed the instruction in the question to use one example of diplomacy, rather than several. Choosing only one example allowed students to discuss in detail the example they had chosen and its impact on a resolution to the crisis.",,22
Humanities,Politics,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEPOERA,VCEPO25EQA7,VCEPOERAER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 7a,ExaminerCommentary,"This question required students to respond to a clear unit of key knowledge from the study design relating to the effectiveness of global actor responses. Students and teachers are reminded that in Unit 3, an effective response describes a response that assists in the resolution of a crisis. Some responses implied that an effective response is when an actor achieves their interest, which may be a more appropriate conclusion to draw in Unit 4. In this question, it was acceptable for students to suggest that an actor was entirely ineffective in their response and provide context for that idea. Higher-scoring responses tended to offer an evidence-based discussion of why an actor's response may or may not be effective, based around ideas such as:",,23

Humanities,Politics,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEPOERA,VCEPO25EQA7,VCEPOERACM,,Question 7a,ExaminerCommentary,"Common limitations on responses to this question were simply describing the narrative of an actor's response, as opposed to engaging in a more detailed explanation about the actor's ability to respond effectively.",,34
Humanities,Politics,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEPOERA,VCEPO25EQA7,VCEPOERAER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 7a,StudentResponse,The following is an example of a high-scoring response:,"China's ability to respond effectively to the Russia-Ukraine crisis, by seeking a solution, is limited because China is unable to put aside its own perspective. China's 2023 12 point Peace Plan, announced exactly a year after the commencement of the war, featured points such as the abandonment of a ""Cold War mentality"" and point 10, the cessation of ""unilateral sanctions"" unless approved by the UN Security Council, where Russia has veto power. This peace plan was not an effective response and demonstrates China's inability to formulate an effective resolution, as it shows that China's pro-Russia neutrality is a road block to a proper peace plan. The plan is reflective of China's disdain for the West's antagonisation and economic isolation of Russia ... the reason China's response or proposed resolution to the crisis is limited in effectiveness is because China's own perspective dominates and prevents agreement.",35
Humanities,Politics,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEPOERA,VCEPO25EQA7,VCEPOERAER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 7b,ExaminerCommentary,"This question ruled out the use of the actor referred to in Question 7a., and if that actor was used, the student could not achieve any marks in Question 7b. Higher-scoring responses demonstrated awareness of the requirements of the 'contrast' command term, which specifically refers to differences. Therefore, students were required to choose perspectives that were opposing, or at least contained fundamental differences that could be contrasted against each other. To be able to achieve full marks, a response needed to correctly identify actors and clear perspectives, and to support those perspectives with references/examples. They also needed to clearly identify where they were discussing the contrast between the perspectives and specifically how the perspectives differed.",,36
Humanities,Politics,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEPOERA,VCEPO25EQA7,VCEPOERACM,,Question 7b,ExaminerCommentary,"Students should be aware of the usually linear relationship between perspectives, interests and actions of global actors, and be able to identify each specifically and compare/contrast these against other actors.",,37
Humanities,Politics,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEPOERA,VCEPO25EQA7,VCEPOERACM,,Question 7b,ExaminerCommentary,"A common limitation in responses to this question was a misunderstanding of the concept of 'perspectives', which are explained in the study design as '... the positions from which political actors see and understand their interests, including the ideologies, ideas, values and events that inform these perspectives'. A beginning point for understanding global actors' actions must therefore be how that actor sees and understands any given situation related to a contemporary crisis.",,38

This was vital to be able to achieve full marks. Some students were also able to identify how foreign aid had been cut and describe a consequence of this situation - an approach that was scored highly. Ultimately, the consequence chosen by the student needed to have some kind of tangible impact for the recipient, the donor or the region.

Similarly, if students chose the USA's use of tariffs, an effective way to access the idea of regional standing would be through multiple perspectives (China and Japan) or perhaps through ASEAN.

Humanities,Politics,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEPOERA,VCEPO25EQA11,VCEPOERAER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 11,StudentResponse,The following is an example of a high-scoring response:,"China's pursuit of security, the achievement of the One-China policy, through the use of military power to threaten the secessionist Taiwan, has been politically significant because as a consequence it has demonstrated China's renunciation of the rules based order and highlighted its fragility. China has used military power by for example, sending 1,727 planes in to Taiwan's Air Defence Identification Zone in 2022, after Nancy Pelosi's August 2022 visit to Taiwan. This is an increase from 960 incursions in 2021. Furthermore, on Christmas Day 2022, China used 71 warplanes to conduct a ""strike exercise"" near Taiwan, in response to Biden signing off on $10 billion of military aid to Taiwan. These displays of military power aim to demonstrate its dominance over Taiwan, coercively aiming to prompt Taiwan to reunite with the Chinese motherland. This is important for China's security as ""secession"" is one of China's three evils, and a secure China relies on the 'one China' policy where China and Taiwan are one and China can maintain control. This is politically significant as it demonstrates China's dissidence and disavowal of the rules based order, which emphasises the importance of respecting the ""territorial integrity and political independence"" (UN Charter article 21) of other states. China's use of military power to threaten Taiwan's sovereignty sets a dangerous global precedent about the validity and security of the stable world order that a cooperative and relatively peaceful world hinges on. Thus China's use of military power for security interests is politically significant to a great extent as it demonstrates the fragility of the global order as it exists today, in the wake of China's dissidence.",94

Higher-scoring responses were able to identify that the question asked for the perspective on Australia's pursuit of regional relationships, as opposed to Australia's perspective on regional relationships themselves. This appeared to be misunderstood by some students, highlighting the importance of reading both the question and the source carefully and closely. While there were multiple perspectives reflected in the source, students needed to identify one correctly and then support this perspective with a relevant passage from the source as evidence.

(Source 2) This can also be enhanced with the Pacific Islands countries' perspective that ""coordination of their financial and technical support for countries"" will also lead to economic prosperity for all parties due to ""[reduced] military spending"" due to the decrease in ""risk of future armed conflict.""",3

Higher-scoring responses were able to link this example directly to their chosen national interest from the question, using evidence to support their conclusion. Conclusions about economic prosperity or security that were not supported with evidence tended not to score highly. If a response suggests that the use of a foreign-policy instrument has enhanced the security of the chosen state, it should cite tangible (and accurate) evidence to support the case. Similarly, if a response suggests that economic prosperity has been achieved to some degree, evidence must be produced to support that claim.",,5

Many responses placed more emphasis on the first part of the question and overlooked the second. Students are reminded to read all aspects of each question to ensure their answer fulfils all the requirements. High-scoring responses included at least one reference to a source, integrating it into the discussion around one or both of the states discussed. These responses also included detailed evidence from the student's own knowledge to support their discussion. A common feature of these responses was to build the discussion around two states with which Australia had differing levels of effective cooperation, using evidence to explain why this was the case. Importantly, if students wanted to argue that cooperation either did or did not occur, evidence was required to substantiate that claim. One way that students were able to show sophistication in their response was to integrate their discussion of both states through making a comparison or evaluative comment about a difference or similarity between Australia's cooperation with each.",,7

The sources should be used in questions such as this as a jumping-off point to a larger and broader discussion, and references to the source/s should be integrated as part of the argument and obvious to the reader.",,8
Humanities,Politics,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEPOERB,VCEPO25EQB3,VCEPOERBER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 3,StudentResponse,The following is an example of a high-scoring response:,"Australia's cooperation with Papua New Guinea (PNG), the largest member of the Pacific Islands Forum, has been somewhat effective. This is as Australia has pursued cooperation with PNG through the provision of foreign aid and the Sports Diplomacy 2032+ plan, a display of diplomacy. Australia's use of diplomacy has been effective in boosting cooperation between the two states, but Australia's use of foreign aid has been criticised by PNG leaders for its ingenuine and transactional purpose. In 2019, the Australian Sports Diplomacy Plan 2032+ was created, dedicating $60 million per year for 10 years for the creation of a PNG National Rugby League team. This was well received by PNG, described by PM James Marape as a ""unifying force"" in an address to the NRL. Thus, Australia has cooperated successfully with PNG, as through the Sports Diplomacy 2032+ policy a connection was established. However, the success of this was greatly undermined by Australia's provision of ""boomerang aid"" to PNG, with $637.4 million in Official Developmental Assistance. However, this was criticised by Ano Pala, the minister for national planning in PNG, as ""boomerang aid"" that was ""reabsorbed by Australian management consultants and contractors"". Thus, Australia's provision of foreign aid to PNG for the purpose of enhancing cooperation has been somewhat counteractive, as it has drawn dissent from a key leader in PNG, thereby undermining cooperation. Conversely, Australia's cooperation with China has been greatly effective, due to the principle of compartmentalisation. Australia and China are at odds in terms of security, as China's increasing influence particularly in the Pacific, such as through its provision of $1.2 million of cash assistance and disaster relief supplies to PNG in 2024, challenges the stable rules based order focused Indo-Pacific. However, the two continue to maintain cooperation through trade, such as in Source 1 image 1, where the ""China Enterprise"" iron ore carrier presumably enters Australia to take Australian iron ore exports. Furthermore, in 2023, trade between the two reached $272 billion, and 27% of Australian exports went to China. Thus, despite China's challenge to Australian security, the two states have effectively compartmentalised, or treated the two issues as separate, and continued trade that is lucrative for both. Thus, Australian cooperation with China has been greatly effective.",9
