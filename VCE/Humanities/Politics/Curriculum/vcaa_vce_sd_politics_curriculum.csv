Humanities,Politics,Year 11,Unit 1,VCEPOU1AS12,,,,Paragraph,,"Unit 1: Politics, power and political actors","Political actors are individuals such as political leaders or ordinary citizens, or organisations such as parliaments or the United Nations, who have some measure of political power and/or authority and who engage in activities that can have a significant influence on decisions, policies, public discussion, media coverage and outcomes associated with a given issue.

Students examine how power may be used by political actors in various states to achieve their interests, and they focus on a close study of a contested political issue in Australia. Students then investigate the power of global actors, who are able to use power across national and regional boundaries to achieve their interests and cooperate with other actors to solve conflicts, issues and crises.",,5
