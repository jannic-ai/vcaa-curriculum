In this study students investigate contemporary issues of conflict, political stability and/or change within Australia, the Indo-Pacific region and globally. They consider how national and global political actors respond to issues and crises such as national political reform, climate change, violent conflicts, human rights, sustainability and development, inequality and global economic instability. Students analyse the sources and forms of power available to these political actors and the consequences of their use. Students consider how political actors pursue their interests and the political significance of their actions in responding to national and global issues and crises. Throughout this study, students examine Australia's place in the region and globally.",,1

VCE Politics assesses how political norms, perspectives, laws and interests influence governance and the operation of governments. Students develop tools for understanding these contemporary political events and challenges. They examine a number of current political systems and processes to better understand how power is used and how conflict may be resolved. They consider the values underpinning liberal democratic societies, including Australia, and assess the range of national and global challenges facing democratic norms and practice. They achieve this by analysing how the different interests and perspectives of political actors affect selected contemporary political issues and crises.",,2

VCE Politics focuses on contemporary issues and crises. This means examples and case studies selected for study should be ongoing or have occurred within the last 10 years. In investigating national, regional and global issues, students consider the causes and consequences of, and different perspectives on, the issues or crises; competing interests of the political actors involved; the political significance of various actors, issues and crises; and the impact of various issues and crises on political stability and/or change. Students develop the ability to construct informed analysis of political phenomena in the society, region and world in which they live, work and learn.",,3

VCE Politics introduces students to the complexities of Australian society and the contemporary world. It broadens their outlook through examining how political change and decision-making happens and how power may be used. This entails understanding how political actors pursue their interests and the political significance of human agency. The study assists students in becoming informed observers of and active participants in Australia's political system, and global citizens who are able to think critically about political issues, crises and challenges to democracy. VCE Politics provides students with opportunities to better understand their own rights, responsibilities and participation as national citizens and members of the global community, and to consider their own political agency and the ways they can contribute to participatory democracy and civic engagement.",,1

Thinking politically helps students to evaluate how political actors can address the challenges that face our national, regional and global communities today and into the future. This includes considering Australia's interactions with other political actors and its positions on issues such as human rights, climate change and development. Students may also examine forms of conflicts such as territorial, economic, military, cultural and diplomatic conflicts.",,2

The study develops critical thinking, research and inquiry skills that support students' capacity for formal study at the tertiary level or in vocational education and training settings and the workplace. It also leads to opportunities in a range of careers, including leadership and management, local and national government, the public service, non-governmental organisations and academia. Students may also pursue occupations in government, not-for-profit organisations, and corporate and private enterprises in fields such as journalism, communications, education, law, research, international aid, diplomacy and politics. Students of VCE Politics acquire knowledge and skills that enhance their employability in all workplaces that need knowledgeable and adaptable problem-solvers who are curious and can think critically, with empathy and intercultural understanding.",,3
