Humanities,Australian History,Year 12,Unit 3,VCEHUU3AS12,,,,Paragraph,,Units 3 and 4: Australian History,"The study of Australian history is considered both within a national and a global context, particularly Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and culture, a colonial settler society within the British Empire and as part of the Asia-Pacific region. Students come to understand that the history of Australia is contested and that the past continues to contribute to ongoing interpretations, debates and tensions in Australian society.",,2
Humanities,Australian History,Year 12,Unit 3,VCEHUU3AS12,,,,Paragraph,,Units 3 and 4: Australian History,"Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures are the oldest, continuous cultures in the world, having existed in Australia for at least 60,000 years. Their custodianship of Country led to the development of unique and sophisticated systems of land management, social structures, cultural beliefs and economic practices. European colonisation of Australia brought devastating and radical changes to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Furthermore, the significant turning points such as European settlement, the gold rushes, Federation, the passage of social, political, and economic reforms, the world wars, the emergence of social movements and Aboriginal recognition and land rights have challenged and changed the social, political, economic, environmental and cultural features of the nation, contributing to development of a multicultural and democratic society. Students explore the factors that have contributed to Australia becoming a successful multicultural and democratic society. Throughout this study, students examine and discuss the experiences, perspectives and historical interpretations of Indigenous as well as non-Indigenous people.",,3
Humanities,Australian History,Year 12,Unit 3,VCEHUU3AS12,,,,Paragraph,,Units 3 and 4: Australian History,"In Units 3 and 4, students construct arguments about the past using historical sources (primary sources and historical interpretations) as evidence to analyse the continuities and changes, and evaluate the extent to which change occurred in the lives of Australians. Students investigate the significant turning points and trends in Australia's past to identify the causes, patterns, direction, pace, depth and impact of continuity and change in society. They consider the extent to which events, ideas, individuals, groups and movements contributed to, influenced and/or resisted change. They consider competing historical interpretations, debates and the diverse perspectives of people at the time and how they may have changed while others may have remained the same.",,4
