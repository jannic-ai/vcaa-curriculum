Humanities,History,Year 11,Units 1 and 2,VCEHIU12AS12,,,,Paragraph,,Units 1 and 2: Empires,"In Units 1 and 2 Empires, students investigate the foundations and features of empires and the significant global changes they brought to the wider world in the early modern period. Empires at their core were expansionist, dominating trade and political influence in their regional or global contexts. A range of key factors arising from the social, political, economic, cultural, religious, environmental and technological features of Empires played a role in the ambition and quest for power, prestige and influence over rival and competing states.",,1
Humanities,History,Year 11,Units 1 and 2,VCEHIU12AS12,,,,Paragraph,,Units 1 and 2: Empires,"By the 15th century, international trade was dominated by the Republic of Venice, the Ming Dynasty in China and the Byzantine Empire. Between them they controlled key trading hubs along the Silk Road and Mediterranean Sea, in cities such as Constantinople, Venice and Beijing. Other empires were regional rather than global in reach: Mughals in India, Ming and Qing in China and the Tsars of Russia. By the 16th century the Ottoman Empire conquered Constantinople and controlled key trading routes. Emerging European powers Portugal, Spain, France, Britain and the Netherlands circumvented the power of these established empires, gaining access to goods through alternative routes. By harnessing new knowledge and technologies, their voyages of exploration into the Asia-Pacific, the Americas and Africa challenged the hegemony of power of existing empires beyond the Mediterranean world.",,2
Humanities,History,Year 11,Units 1 and 2,VCEHIU12AS12,,,,Paragraph,,Units 1 and 2: Empires,"Mindsets also changed. Emergent new ideas of the Renaissance brought forth innovative theories of the Scientific Revolution, the reforms of Protestant Reformation and the Counter-Reformation and, later, the Enlightenment. New economic structures of capitalism and mercantilism and the political ideas of absolute authority enabled Western European empires to entrench and impose their power on their colonial subjects. Consequently, new trade networks such as the 'Columbian Exchange' increased the prevalence and reliance on the slave trade and the demand for resources. Europe and Asia profited in their monopolies at the expense of indigenous cultures and environmental sustainability.",,3
Humanities,History,Year 11,Units 1 and 2,VCEHIU12AS12,,,,Paragraph,,Units 1 and 2: Empires,"Imperial exploitation of colonial outposts and occupied territories drastically affected the indigenous peoples and the colonial societies. The local and international rivalries that ensued had an impact on the management and defence of empires. Wars and conflicts escalated as the quest for territorial power and resources intensified, culminating in the Seven Year's War, which later influenced the revolutions within America, France and Haiti.",,4

Empires continued to exert their powers as they competed for new territories, resources and labour across Asia-Pacific, Africa and the Americas, contributing to tremendous change. This increasingly brought these world powers into contact and conflict. Italian unification and German unification changed the balance of power in Europe, the USA emerged from a bitter civil war and the Meiji Restoration brought political revolution to Japan. Meanwhile, China under the Qing struggled to survive due to foreign imperialism. Modernisation and industrialisation also challenged and changed the existing political, social and economic authority of empires and states. During this time the everyday lives of people significantly changed.",,2

It represented a complete departure from the past and heralded changes that were to have significant consequences for the rest of the twentieth century. The post-war treaties ushered in a period where the world was, to a large degree, reshaped with new borders, movements, ideologies and power structures and led to the creation of many new nation states. These changes had many unintended consequences that would lay the foundations for future conflict and instability in Europe, the Americas, Asia, Africa and the Middle East.

In Germany, the persecution of the Jewish people and other minorities intensified, resulting, during World War Two, in the Holocaust. In the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), millions of people were forced to work in state-owned factories and farms and had limited personal freedom. Japan became increasingly militarised and anti-Western. Turkey emerged out of the ruins of the Ottoman Empire and embarked on reforms to establish a secular democracy. In the United States of America (USA), foreign policy was shaped by isolationism, and the consumerism and material progress of the Roaring Twenties was tempered by the Great Depression in 1929.
