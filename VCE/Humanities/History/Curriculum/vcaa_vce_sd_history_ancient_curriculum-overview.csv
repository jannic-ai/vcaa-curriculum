Humanities,Ancient History,Years 11 and 12,"VCEHAU3AS1,VCEHAU3AS2",VCEHA12OVSC01,Scope of study,,Paragraph,"History is a dynamic discipline that involves structured inquiry into the human actions, forces and conditions (social, political, economic, cultural, environmental and technological) that have shaped the past and present. To make meaning of the past, historians use historical sources, which include primary sources and historical interpretations. Historians analyse and evaluate evidence and use this when constructing historical arguments. As historians ask new questions, revise interpretations, or discover new sources, fresh understandings about the past come to light.",,1
Humanities,Ancient History,Years 11 and 12,"VCEHAU3AS1,VCEHAU3AS2",VCEHA12OVSC02,Scope of study,,Paragraph,"Although history deals with the particular - specific individuals and key events - the potential scope of historical inquiry is vast and formed by the questions that historians pursue, the availability of historical sources, and the capacity of historians to interpret those sources. VCE History reflects this by enabling students to explore a variety of eras and periods, events, people, places and ideas.",,2
Humanities,Ancient History,Years 11 and 12,"VCEHAU3AS1,VCEHAU3AS2",VCEHA12OVSC03,Scope of study,,Paragraph,"Ancient History investigates individuals and societies (Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece, Rome and China) across three millennia. Empires explores the ideas and power relations accompanying the growth of empires in the early modern period. Modern History examines the causes and consequences of conflict and change in the modern era. Australian History investigates continuity and change from pre-colonial times to the modern day. Revolutions explores the causes and consequences of significant social upheaval (America, France, Russia and China) in the modern period.",,3
Humanities,Ancient History,Years 11 and 12,"VCEHAU3AS1,VCEHAU3AS2",VCEHA12OVRA01,Rationale,,Paragraph,"The study of VCE History assists students to understand themselves, others, and the contemporary world, and broadens their perspective by examining events, ideas, individuals, groups and movements. Students of VCE History develop social, political, economic and cultural understandings of the conditions and features which have helped shape the present. They also explore continuity and change: the world is not as it has always been, and it will be subject to change in the future. In this sense, history is relevant to contemporary issues. It fosters an understanding of human agency and informs decision making in the present.",,1
Humanities,Ancient History,Years 11 and 12,"VCEHAU3AS1,VCEHAU3AS2",VCEHA12OVRA02,Rationale,,Paragraph,"The study of VCE History fosters the ability to ask searching questions, to engage in independent research and to construct arguments about the past based on evidence from historical sources. Historical comprehension enables a source to be understood in relation to its context; that is, students make links between the historical source and the world context in which it was produced.",,2
Humanities,Ancient History,Years 11 and 12,"VCEHAU3AS1,VCEHAU3AS2",VCEHA12OVRA03,Rationale,,Paragraph,"We can never know the whole past. Historical knowledge rests on the interpretation of historical sources that are used as evidence. Furthermore, judgments about historical significance made by historians are central to the discipline. Historians do not always agree about the meaning of the past; historical interpretations are often subject to academic and popular debate. Therefore, history is contested, and students develop an ability to work within this contested space to form their own opinions and to defend them using evidence. The study of VCE History equips students to enhance their critical thinking, take an informed position on how the past informs the present and future, and contributes to them becoming informed and engaged citizens.",,3
