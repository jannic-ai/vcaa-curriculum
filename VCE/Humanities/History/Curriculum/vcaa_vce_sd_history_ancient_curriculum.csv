Humanities,Ancient History,Year 11,Unit 1,VCEHAU1AS12,,,,Paragraph,,Unit 1: Ancient Mesopotamia,"In this unit students investigate the emergence of early societies in Ancient Mesopotamia. The lands between the rivers Tigris and the Euphrates have been described as the 'cradle of civilisation'. Although this view is now contested in ancient history and archaeology, the study of Ancient Mesopotamia provides important insights about the growth of cities and the development of civilisations. Students investigate the creation of city-states and empires. They examine the invention of writing - a pivotal development in human history. Students develop their understanding of the importance of primary sources (the material record and written sources) to inquire about the origins of civilisation.",,1
