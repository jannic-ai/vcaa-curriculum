Humanities,History,VCEHRV,Revolutions,Year 12,Units 3 and 4,VCEHRVU34AS12,,,,Paragraph,,Units 3 and 4: Revolutions,"In Units 3 and 4 Revolutions students investigate the significant historical causes and consequences of political revolution. Revolutions represent great ruptures in time and are a major turning point in the collapse and destruction of an existing political order which results in extensive change to society. Revolutions are caused by the interplay of events, ideas, individuals and popular movements, and the interplay between the political, social, cultural, economic and environmental conditions. Their consequences have a profound effect on the political and social structures of the post-revolutionary society. Revolution is a dramatically accelerated process whereby the new regime attempts to create political, social, cultural and economic change and transformation based on the regime's ideology.",,1
Humanities,History,VCEHRV,Revolutions,Year 12,Units 3 and 4,VCEHRVU34AS12,,,,Paragraph,,Units 3 and 4: Revolutions,"Change in a post-revolutionary society is not guaranteed or inevitable and continuities can remain from the pre-revolutionary society. The implementation of revolutionary ideology was often challenged internally by civil war and externally by foreign threats. These challenges can result in a compromise of revolutionary ideals and extreme measures of violence, oppression and terror.",,2
Humanities,History,VCEHRV,Revolutions,Year 12,Units 3 and 4,VCEHRVU34AS12,,,,Paragraph,,Units 3 and 4: Revolutions,"In these units students construct an argument about the past using historical sources (primary sources and historical interpretations) as evidence to analyse the complexity and multiplicity of the causes and consequences of revolution, and to evaluate the extent to which the revolution brought change to the lives of people. Students analyse the different perspectives and experiences of people who lived through dramatic revolutionary moments, and how society changed and/or remained the same. Students use historical interpretations to evaluate the causes and consequences of revolution and the extent of change instigated by the new regime.",,3
