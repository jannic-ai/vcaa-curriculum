Humanities,History,VCEHAN,Ancient History,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEHANER,VCEHANERGC,General Comments,,"Two areas that remain a challenge for students are using specific historical details (especially dates) to substantiate factual claims, and using quotations (from historians or historical persons) to support interpretations.",,1
Humanities,History,VCEHAN,Ancient History,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEHANER,VCEHANERGC,General Comments,,Some general observations and advice based on common issues are as follows:,,2
Humanities,History,VCEHAN,Ancient History,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEHANER,VCEHANERGC,General Comments,,"Students should carefully read the questions and identify the command term, any key terms in the question (especially those reflecting the key knowledge in the study design), which if any source to use, what if any timeframe the question relates to and the interactions between the elements of the question.",,3
Humanities,History,VCEHAN,Ancient History,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEHANER,VCEHANERGC,General Comments,,Students should carefully read the explanatory notes to the sources. They are useful and provide contextual information which can help the student to avoid errors of interpretation (especially for visual sources which are not necessarily self-explanatory).,,4
Humanities,History,VCEHAN,Ancient History,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEHANER,VCEHANERGC,General Comments,,"Students should not use Egyptian, Greek or Latin words without defining and explaining them. Where a standard English word can convey the meaning, that should be used. Where the word has a specialised historical meaning, it must be unpacked to show its relevance.",,5
Humanities,History,VCEHAN,Ancient History,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEHANER,VCEHANERGC,General Comments,,"When quoting a historian, the relevance of the quotation must be made clear - it either supports an assessment the student has just made or provides a starting point for such an assessment.",,6
Humanities,History,VCEHAN,Ancient History,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEHANER,VCEHANERGC,General Comments,,"Key terms in questions should be defined in some way in the response (especially for more challenging questions and essay topics). This is useful to give the response a clear focus and enhance the relevance of what the student writes. In the essays, for example, very few students ever explicitly stated what was meant by 'the crisis of the Amarna Period', 'outcome of the Decelean (Ionian) War' or 'the downfall of the Roman Republic'.",,7
Humanities,History,VCEHAN,Ancient History,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEHANER,VCEHANERGC,General Comments,,Students should not claim that things were 'inevitable' or 'obvious' (if they were we would have no need to make historical arguments).,,8
Humanities,History,VCEHAN,Ancient History,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEHANER,VCEHANERGC,General Comments,,"Students should avoid counterfactuals; it is not good history writing to base an argument on what might have happened, for example, if there was no Second Triumvirate and there was a free-for-all civil conflict between Octavian, Antony, Lepidus, the liberatores and Sextus Pompey.",,9
