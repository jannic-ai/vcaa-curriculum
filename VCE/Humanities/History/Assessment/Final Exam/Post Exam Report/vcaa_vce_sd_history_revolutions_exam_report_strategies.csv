Humanities,Revolutions,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEHRERA,,VCEHRERACM,,Section A - General Comments,ExaminerCommentary,"Section A consisted of four questions, one for each revolution, divided into multiple parts. The Sources Book contained the stimulus material and, for each revolution, comprised a single visual representation, a single written primary source document and two written historical interpretations.",,1
Humanities,Revolutions,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEHRERA,,VCEHRERACM,,Section A - General Comments,ExaminerCommentary,"For each revolution, there were two 'identify' questions that required students to identify visual and written features of a visual source. As there was no explicit instruction to describe or expound on this information, students were able to simply identify the various features that corresponded to the prescribed questions. Dot points worked well here, although many students chose to explain in detail how their answers addressed the question, which was not required. Overall, most students demonstrated a high capacity to identify the various visual and written features of the sources.",,2
Humanities,Revolutions,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEHRERA,,VCEHRERAER,EnhancedStrategies,Section A - General Comments,ExaminerCommentary,"Part c. and d. questions for all revolutions featured both an 'explain' question, which generally related to a revolutionary individual, and an 'analyse' question that required students to analyse the extent to which change occurred for a particular group. Students were required to adhere strictly to the time and topic constraints provided, maintaining focus on the assigned subject matter. Higher-scoring responses effectively integrated the question, their own perspectives, relevant source material and additional knowledge to substantiate their arguments. Conversely, lower-scoring responses often drifted into a narration of topics without clear alignment to the question's requirements, strayed off topic by including information from outside the designated time period, or relied heavily on reproduction of source material.",,3
Humanities,Revolutions,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEHRERA,,VCEHRERACM,,Section A - General Comments,ExaminerCommentary,"Each revolution also featured an eight-mark 'evaluate' question, asking students to independently assess and justify their judgments with other evidence. This assessment also required students to use source material; thus, responses that failed to incorporate the required source could not receive high scores for this question. These questions were all based on Area of Study 2 for each revolution. Therefore, responses with expansive discussion of Area of Study 1 content without discussion of change that occurred fell short in delivering a comprehensive grasp of the subject matter.",,4

America's focus was on the extent to which the Bill of Rights enabled leaders to achieve their ideals. France's was on the extent to which Federalist and counter-revolutionary revolts challenged the survival of the new regime. The Russian question required an evaluation of Lenin's leadership and the extent to which it enabled the survival of the new regime, while the Chinese question required an evaluation of the consequences of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution (GPCR) on Chinese society.

Humanities,Revolutions,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEHRERA,VCEHR24EQA1,VCEHRERAER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 1c,StudentResponse,,"Thomas Paine transported the Enlightenment ideas of a republican government and liberty to a wider colonial audience, propelling the Revolution. Source 2 depicts how through 'Common Sense' (10 January 1776) Paine argued 'A government of their own was their natural right', evidencing how this pamphlet challenged existing notions of connection with Britain, as exemplified by the olive branch petition (5 July 1775). Thus, Paine was a key impetus in spreading further for a Republic, to escape the tyrannical encroachments of the British monarchy. Moreover, source to conveys pains argument that Britain acted as 'brutus' in making war upon the colonists. This exemplifies how liberty, and freedom from tyrannical overreach echoed through his pamphlet, necessitating a disruption to the colonists' connection with Great Britain. Furthermore, 'Common Sense' emphasises how Paine's ideas challenged the existing order. 100 copies were sold in a fortnight, and 100,000 in a year, as the ideas of republicanism and liberty were dispensed throughout the lower colonial classes. Hence, Thomas Paine's ideas on a decisive separation from British monarchy and the uplift of liberty furthered the revolutionary cause, underpinning the Declaration of Independence (6 July 1776).",31
Humanities,Revolutions,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEHRERA,VCEHR24EQA1,VCEHRERACM,,Question 1d,ExaminerCommentary,"Question 1d. was handled with mixed success overall. Most students were able to utilise the source effectively, discussing how the settlers pushed ever increasingly westward, and many students were able to accurately detail the position of Native Americans prior to the revolution.",,32
Humanities,Revolutions,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEHRERA,VCEHR24EQA1,VCEHRERALR,LimitedStrategies,Question 1d,ExaminerCommentary,"However, some students lacked the specificity of own knowledge to detail how the experiences of Native Americans were changed by the revolution. Lower-scoring responses clung to the source, most often simply transcribing the source material, or detailing the experience of Native Americans with more of a focus on their position prior to the revolution, while ignoring any real analysis on how this changed following the revolution up to 1789.",,33
Humanities,Revolutions,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEHRERA,VCEHR24EQA1,VCEHRERAER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 1d,ExaminerCommentary,"Higher-scoring responses detailed ideas such as how Native Americans were left unprotected and how they were increasingly seen by many as a conquered people (as many sided with the British) and therefore their land was deemed conquered territory after the war. These responses provided a baseline reading for the status of Native Americans, then made a clear analytical statement on how this position changed. These responses that were able to cover the entire time period and provide a higher level of specificity to their evidence scored well here.",,34
Humanities,Revolutions,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEHRERA,VCEHR24EQA1,VCEHRERAER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 1d,StudentResponse,The following is an example of a high-scoring response to Question 1d.:,"The experiences of Native Americans before and after the revolution was hallmarked by fluctuations in conflict and power. Source 3 argues how Native Americans were impacted as 'numerous British American settlers pushed westward' after the Proclamation Act (7 October 1763). 175,000 Native Americans were impacted by these encroachments of their land, provoking a period of conflict in Pontiacs rebellion (1763-66). This shifted during the war as 'Native Americans found themselves in a position of relative power', as their allegiances with the British afforded them protection. Yet, this would change again after the colonial victory, as the Treaty of Paris (10 February 1783) and the Northwest Ordinance (13 July 1787) sanctioned colonial expansion into Native American territory. Hence the Native Americans experienced unstable positions of power and weaknesses during the revolution, as their authority in their land changed.",35

Others provided an extended narration of the time period and ended with the ratification of the Bill, without any real evaluation as to whether or not it achieved any of the revolutionary leaders' aims. These responses highlighted little understanding of ideas such as how the Bill of Rights would act as the compromise that would save the Constitution.",,37

Students typically knew the first few amendments well (many were contained in the source material). However, the higher-level responses were able to move beyond this to include specific own evidence, such as the 10th Amendment to the Constitution relating to State's Rights, which was utilised well to justify their arguments. Some of the more successful responses also recognised that the Bill of Rights only protected the liberties of a privileged section of the population, and that the rights of many living in the new Republic remained unprotected.",,38

Humanities,Revolutions,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEHRERA,VCEHR24EQA1,VCEHRERAER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 1e,StudentResponse,,"The Bill of Rights directly safeguarded the Americans from infringements on natural rights undertaken by the British, successfully achieving the ideal of securing individual liberty. As Source 4 captures, 'antipathy towards a strong central government was only one concern', as 'many ... feared it did not protect individual rights'. Amendment 4 of the bill, however, directly addresses the Writes of Assistance that had provoked leaders to pursue revolution, with the 'right of the people to be secure ... against unreasonable searches and seizures ... shall not be violated'. What James Otis claimed the 'most destructive of English liberty' was directly prohibited by the Bill, confirming Bailyn's view that it was the 'apotheosis of the revolution'. Similarly, Amendment 7 maintained 'in all criminal trials, the accused shall have access to an impartial jury' directly ensuring that the Administration of Justice Act (20 May 1774) could not be repeated. Alongside Amendment 1, preserving the freedom of speech, press, religion' (Source 4), it's clear that the bill ensured British tyranny could not occur again.",41

Humanities,Revolutions,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEHRERA,VCEHR24EQA2,VCEHRERAER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 2c,StudentResponse,The following is an example of a high-scoring response to Question 2c.:,"The actions of ""Madam deficit"", (S6) Marie Antoinette, seriously damaged the image of the old regime and angered the 'menu pueple'. S6 outlines the Queen's ""headless extravagance in difficult times"" (S6), such as the 2 million livres price tag of the 1783 renovations of the Petit Trianon whilst ""poverty was France's most visible social problem"" (Doyle). People resented the financial ""privileges of the monarchy"" (S6) and sought to address it's corruption. Importantly, Marie Antoinette's undermining of Calonne in 1787 and empowerment of Brienne in 1780 with ""gifts, offices and money"" (S6) characterised the monarchy as a corrupt functionless consumer of wealth, a stark juxtaposition to the economic suffering of ordinary people. Whilst not directly attributable to the Queen's actions, her rumoured sexual promiscuity delegitimized the idea of divine right monarchy as Louis XVI's heirs may not be his after all. This resulted in a flurry of crude political pamphlets as the Queens extravagance generated discontent with the monarchy and offended its traditional supporters before 1789.",47

Lower-scoring responses tended to narrate or over-relied on the source material and lacked specific own knowledge. They also tended to fixate on the powers of the King without detailing how they changed between 1789 and 1791. A small number of responses misinterpreted elements of The Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen as the Constitution, declaring them the same document, which indicated a lack of understanding.",,48

Having ""inherited a power too contested to remain an absolute monarch"", (Furet) Louis XVI Conceded to the National Assembly on 15 July 1789 and committed the monarchy to the fate of ""constitutional"" restrictions and ""veto"" (S7). The survival of divine-right hereditary absolutism was attacked in the ""destruction of the old social order"" (S7) of privileges. On 5-6 October 1789, the women's March on Versailles brought the monarchy to the Tuileries Palace, effectively prisoners of the revolution, having ""surrendered ... his power to a mob"" (S7). However, Louis sought to avenge absolutism with the 20-25 June 1791 ""flight to Varennes"" (S7) when he failed to escape the revolution and encouraged republicanism. This undermined the 1791 constitution which granted the former despot a mere suspensive veto as the monarchy was merely symbolic and became a reminder of France's plutocracy. Absolute monarchy no longer had a role in France by 1791 as Louis' missteps and the National Constituent Assemblies persecution of symbols of long-term hardship condemned the monarchy to the dustbin of history for the time being.",50

The revolts of Lyon, Bordeaux and Marseilles were significant in their opposition to the National Convention's seemingly arbitrary rule and Paris' radicalism. Likewise the Vendee rebellion of 1793-1794 undermined the newly established order of France as ""the convention is weak because it has been abandoned"", raising a 40,000 strong army to repudiate the gains of the revolution. The opposition within France caused economic problems with hoarding of grain, sugar, candles, coffee and soap due to regional discontent, which in turn generated urban instability such as the 4-5 September 1793 day of the Enrages. By 1793, the assignattiad dropped 51% of the face value and wages were stagnant.",56

Having ""revitalised justice in a republican style"" (S8) the convention established the machinery of state-sanctioned violence. Marseilles, a ""vile and rebellios city"" (S8) was dealt with ""swift and terrible mass shootings"" (S8), as Nante's in the Vendee Witnessed mass drownings that killed up to 4800. ""The Death of the scoundrels"" (S8) was endorsed by national government to ""replace the supreme tribunal of the peoples vengeance"" (Danton) with the Revolutionary Tribunal. Over 70% of deaths in the Terror occurred in the Vendee and Federalist regions an ""none played a greater role in terrorising the nations than the representatives on mission"" (Borsher). In this sense, internal dissidents posed a military and political threat to the new regime, however the Convention was well equipped with amoral deputies and the means to ""organise the despotism of liberty"" (Robespierre) to subdue these threats and ensure the survival of revolutionary gains.",57

This bred discontent within the 4th Duma, who formed a liberal progressive block in opposition to the Tsarina. The progressive blocks opposition to the Tsarina was also derived from their, as well as the general public's distrust of the Tsarina's relationship with Grigori Rasputin, as evidenced by [Grigory Rasputin] ""said so and I absolutely believe it"" (S10).

The lack of Bolshevik majority, only 175 seats gained of the total 707, threatened the legitimacy of the regime. Compared to the socialist revolutionaries gaining 370 seats, it was only ""logical and consistent"" (Protasev) that Lenin dismissed the assembly to crush opposition before it arose. This not only showed Lenin's ability as a leader to enable survival of the Bolshevik regime at any cost, but his reversion to ""dictatorship and terror"" (Source 12) in the face of opposition. This strategy would continue with the creation of the CHEKA (17 December 1917) who carried out 140,000 executions and a further 120,000 casualties whilst suppressing peasant rebellions during the Red Terror of September 1918-1921.

The immense unpopularity of grain requisitioning led to over 15,000 grain requisition agents murdered. The largest of these rebellions, the Tambov revolt - with 40,000 partisan peasants troops - threatened the new regime immensely. Though the policies of War Communism arguably allowed Lenin to ""win the civil war"" (Source 12) as grain requisitioning allowed them to literally starve their opponents, it also led to the horrifying death of 5 million (Figes) in the 1921 famine. This polarised the former ""reddest of the red"" (Trotsky) at Kronstadt, against Lenin's regime, leading to the Rebellion of March 1921.

Furthermore, this low morale caused many GMD soldiers to switch sides, meaning ""Jiang could never wholly rely on his supported supporters"" (Source 15).

However, after the revolution, peasants' lives changed, especially with the Agrarian Land reform Law and mass campaign of Fanshen, which involved overturning ownership of the land, as well as the soil to reap great benefit.

Mao launched the culture revolution with the intent of re-establishing his power after stepping down from leadership, utilising hero worship through the red guards to both increase the respect of young people for his leadership and kill those who had opposed him. He chose students for his ""first instrument of terror"" (Chang), consequently resulting in immense violence and fearful respect throughout China, with teachers and authority figures ""tortured and in extreme cases murdered"" (Source 16). This illustrates Mao's willingness to co-opt social groups for the sake of his own power and harm a significant portion of his own population to cement his position as a God-like figure who was ""worshipped by the people"" (Tong Lin). Mao also utilised staged events, such as his 'good swim' to create a perception of him as superhuman.

The Massachusetts committee of correspondence (12 November 1772) facilitated communication amongst the colonies, spurring a movement that would spread across the colonies. Gordon wood contends that without the committees, ""the revolution would have been disorganised and likely unsuccessful"", emphasising the importance of these groups in the outbreak of revolution. Moreover, the committees of inspection would ensure a homogeneous approach to colonial opposition to Great Britain, considered ""beacons that steady our revolution"" by Thomas Paine. It would be the committees of correspondence that would alert 1200 militiamen to Lexington and Concord (19-20 April 1775), underpinning their importance in facilitating revolutionary action. Furthermore, the provincial congresses acted in open defiance to the Massachusetts government act of 20 May 1774, which prohibited the colony to 1 meeting per year. This allowed the colonist to ""continue their revolutionary actions and organisation"" (Nash), and thus the provincial congresses were vital in continuing revolutionary sentiment until the outbreak of revolution itself. Thus, the committees of correspondence and the provincial congresses were key popular movements that organised colonial resistance, resulting in the outbreak of revolution.",26

Notably, the return of 8000 soldiers from the American war of independence ""brought with them the seeds of independence"" (Madame Campan) proving that an enlightenment inspired society could be achieved. Even before the monarchy of Louis XVI gave signs of weakness, the desire for knowledge infected France and imbued hope in the nobility and bourgeoisie for a government where they had formal influence. On 20 August 1786 when Calonne approached the king with 112 million livres deficit and plans for fiscal reform, it provided these ambitious groups ample opportunity to weaken absolutism and advance themselves to power. First, the assembly of Notables was held from 25 February to 22 May 1787. Doyle explains the mistake of calling the assembly as ""the regime had implicitly admitted that it needed some show of popular support to sustain its credit"". The assembly undermined royal prerogatives, refusing to approve new taxes unless ""we know the returns of the economy"" (Lafayette) despite the accumulating debt and high interest loans. ""The Notables where the first revolutionaries"" (Schama) as they entered the fight against taxation reform and the abolition of privilege with a focus on the Enlightenment. In accordance with Rousseau, the Notables claimed they 'did not represent the general will' nor the 'true representatives of the nation' as mostly members of the second estate. This exposed the ultimate plutocracy of the ancient regime's power was centralised in an incompetent king. Thus, on the basis of the ideas of the Enlightenment, the nobility challenged the status quo which was under threat of financial collapse.",37

Finally, it is worth noting, however, that the creation of the Dumas and Tsar Nicholas subsequent limiting of their powers made the failings of the Tsarist regime all the clearer, thus contributing to the eventual outbreak of revolution. The Duma was established following the 1905 revolution and the October manifesto (17 Oct 1905), creating a parliamentary body to advise Nicholas, despite his distaste for the notion. Despite Nicholas's best attempts to limit the power of the Duma through the Fundamental Laws of 23 April 1906, the 1st Duma offered nearly 400 criticisms during its 73 day term. Three more Dumas followed with Nicholas dissolving and re-electing them as he pleased using his article 105 powers, demonstrating to the Russian people the true lack of change created by the 1905 Revolution, and Nicholas' stranglehold over power. While the third Duma, which Stolypin described as ""comprised of responsible and statesman like people"", the events of the Lena Massacre of 1912 proved that the governments strict control of society was only there to benefit Nicholas, and not the people. The failing of the Dumas to make any real change to Russian society made it increasingly clear to the Russian people that ""meaningful change could not occur as long as the Tsarist regime remained in any capacity"" (Medarda), contributing to the inevitability of revolution. Overall, liberal reforms and Tsar Nicholas' subsequent limitations on them clearly illustrate the impossible nature of a fair society under Tsarist rule, highlighting the need for revolution.",49

Moreover, the success of Mao Zedong Thought in building a formidable and disciplined Red Army allowed for the communist's to win the civil war (1946-1949). First developed at Jiangganhshan and then at Jiangxi, Maoist principles such as ""do not take even a needle a single piece of thread from the masses"" (Mao) enabled the Red Army to flourish as an ideologically united force. Maoism further infused the Red Army at Yanan with emphasis on principles such as self-efficiency leading to the Red Army to grow 40% of their own food. Not only did these Maoist principles engender the development of the Red Army as one that won the support of the masses, but also instilled a sense of discipline and fierce loyalty within them. Renamed the People's Liberation army (August 1946), the core principles of Maoism essentially propelled the communists into victory in the Chinese civil war. Yet, once again, the revolution could not have occurred without the simultaneous failures of the GMD regime. The nationalist army was rampant with corruption and had been devastated by the loss of 3,000,000 troops in the Second Sino-Japanese war of 1937 to 1945 just prior. As such, although Mao Zedong Thought underlay the success of the Red Army and the outbreak of the revolution, so did the nationalist army's failures also allow for the Red Army victory.",59

As Source 2 states, these measures were 'a series of punitive laws' designed to punish the Boston Tea Party (16 December 1773). The Boston Port Act (31 March 1774), which blockaded the port of Boston, threatened the economic livelihood of a city that relied on seagoing trade and the port as a means to stay connected with the other colonies. In addition to this, the Massachusetts Government Act (20 May 1774), which dissolved the Assembly and installed Thomas Gage as military governor, reignited old memories of prior struggles with soldiers, such as the Boston Massacre (5 March 1770). The very act of dissolving a colonial government was simply offensive to the very idea of British government and popular sovereignty. Thus, the Coercive Acts, as a punitive measure, injured the rights of colonists.",38

As Source 3 states, during the war, laws had been enacted to 'confiscate the property of prominent loyalists'. As a result of these measures, Loyalists often found themselves driven from their homes, businesses and even political positions. Loyalists made up one-third of the population by John Adams's estimate, but this was not evenly distributed. In the South, with more Loyalists, the war took almost the character of a civil war, as Loyalists faced angry neighbours who were more interested in profiteering and settling disputes than high-minded ideals of liberty, as Alan Taylor argues.",49

Thus with Lady Liberty depicted as placing an olive branch on Washington's head, his role reflective in Source 4 is that of bringing liberty to America, with the 7-year long campaign from the Battle of White Plains (1777) to Battle of Yorktown (1781-83)... The eagle depicted is representation of Washington's ability to be an icon of peace, freedom and strength, which would establish his influence at the Annapolis convention (1786) and Philadelphia convention (1787) and help create support in fixing the Articles of Confederation government (1777)... Thus, the flag of the United States depicted in Source 4 extends the representation of Washington's influence to his creation of a strong central authority in the Constitution (1787), representing its ratification, eventually nominated as the 1st President of the United States with an overwhelming majority of 78%, infusing the liberty rhetoric from his years as commander in new legislation of America.",63

The cost of the fight against internal and external threats forced the National Convention to issue 'new assignats' in an attempt to bring control to the suffering economy. However, this had the unintended consequence of hyperinflation and a 'rapid rise' in living costs. The movement of peasant men to fight against the foreign armies, as evident by levée en masse of 300 000 men each in February and October 1793, led to a shortfall of labour and harvests, worsening the 'food crisis'. Goods such as candles, soap and firewood grew more expensive, as did bread, costing '8 sous per pound' at a time where country-dwellers and Parisians were only earning 20 and 40 sous per day, respectively. The scarcity of bread increased its prices, triggering unrest and riots on bakeries and grain silos throughout 1792 and 1793. The Vendée especially, angered by the levée en masse and the impacts of famine, staged a major rebellion. The war with the European powers also meant trade declined, and blockades of the trade towns like Lyon and Marseille contributed to the struggling economy. These areas were the centre of a rebellion led by federalists that the Paris-centric government of France was failing, as it had failed to alleviate the rampant economic issues.",106

The urban workers' violent demonstration against authority is depicted by the pikes they wield. This alludes to the Revolutionary Commune (9 August 1792) issuing pikes to the sans-culottes under Petion, inciting their violent insurrection of the Tuileries (10 August 1792) which triggered the loss of the King Louis XVI's authority, thus creating new challenges for the National Convention regarding the fate of the monarchy. Secondly, Source 8 depicts the violent massacre of priests during the September massacres (2-6 September 1792).

Humanities,Revolutions,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEHRERA,VCEHR25EQA3,VCEHRERAER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 3b,StudentResponse,,"Firstly, Kerensky's poor decision to launch the disastrous June Offensive (Jun 1917) against Germany (in a bid to revitalise the military's patriotism) was crucial in providing the Bolsheviks the military support they required to seize power in October. The offensive against Germany was a total failure, with 400 000 soldiers killed, 400 000 deserting and 48 battalions mutinying. As Source 10 explains, 'the army was incapable of fighting', due to lack of morale, and unwillingness to support the Provisional Government, which led to soldiers joining the Bolsheviks' Military Revolutionary Committee, key to the party's swift seizure of the Winter Palace in Oct 1917. Importantly, however, Lenin's role as an opposing leader to Kerensky, and his promise of 'peace' to the war-weary soldiers of World War I (1914-1918) also contributed to the Bolsheviks securing the military support necessary for their seizure of power.",149
Humanities,Revolutions,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEHRERA,VCEHR25EQA3,VCEHRERAER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 3b,StudentResponse,,"As well as military support, Kerensky's inept leadership, demonstrated by his impotency during the Kornilov Affair (Aug 1918) was also important to the Bolsheviks securing the popular support and military capacity necessary to seizing power. Believing General Kornilov was advancing his 15 000 troops on Petrograd to overthrow the Provisional Government, Kerensky, who had 'authority but no power' (Kerensky) released Bolsheviks from prison and armed them with 40 000 guns. This reliance on the Bolsheviks to defend the capital humiliated his government, and tarnished his reputation in the eyes of the Russian people. Thus, his poor handling of the Kornilov Affair provided the Bolsheviks with the popular support and arms necessary to seize power in Oct 1917.",150

Kerensky promised that 'he would put them down' if the Bolsheviks threatened revolution. So, when the Bolsheviks released a notice of an imminent overthrow of the Provisional Government, Kerensky launched a pre-emptive offensive, shutting down Bolshevik newspapers. This gave Lenin and the Bolsheviks the excuse to defend the socialist revolution, and ultimately triggered their seizure of power in late October 1917.",151

Humanities,Revolutions,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEHRERA,VCEHR25EQA4,VCEHRERAER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 4b,StudentResponse,,The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) used the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945) to strengthen their position against the Guomindang (GMD) by appearing more efficient at fulfilling the principles of Nationalism and People's Livelihood.,203
Humanities,Revolutions,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEHRERA,VCEHR25EQA4,VCEHRERAER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 4b,StudentResponse,,"The CCP exhibited increased acts of nationalism during the Second Sino-Japanese War that strengthened their position... The GMD's consistent 'military defeats' (S14), including Shanghai (12th August - November 1937) where they lost 250 000 of their best troops, depicted them as weak and unable to sufficiently defend their people. The subsequent adoption of the strategy to 'trade space for time' (Chiang) resulted in the loss of 400 miles of Chinese territory, including Nanjing (13th December 1937). The GMD's abandonment of the city essentially betrayed its people, allowing 300 000 to be killed ... by the Japanese who treated them as 'ants crawling on the ground' (Japanese officer) ... demonstrating an inability to protect the people and displayed Chiang as a 'cruel, incompetent dictator' (Fenby). However, the CCP capitalised on such failures ... with the dismantling of 970 km of railway track and killing of 55 ranking Japanese officers. In addition, the launching of the Hundred Regiments Offensive (August 1940) where 22 000 Red Army soldiers patriotically sacrificed their lives for the country reinforced a series of heroic acts in order to protect the people. Thus, the CCP's enthusiastic fulfilment of nationalism in comparison to the GMD's failures assured that the GMD's 'supporters found it difficult to maintain their loyalty' (Lynch), exemplified by the 800 000 who joined the Red Army by 1945.",204
Humanities,Revolutions,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEHRERA,VCEHR25EQA4,VCEHRERAER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 4b,StudentResponse,,"Furthermore, the CCP strengthened their position over the GMD by fulfilling People's Livelihood... The GMD largely allowed 'the oppression of the people' (S14) as the war led to dire conditions... This led taxes to rise 70-90% in some GMD controlled areas, resulting in a famine in Henan (1942)... Conversely, the CCP used the war and strengthened their position by capitalising on such failures. The conditions at the Yan'an Soviet were quite the opposite for 'peasant, youth, women's cultural and other organisations' (S14) with tax rates of 20-25%... The additional campaigns against foot binding and for education demonstrated the utmost willingness to satisfy the needs of the people ... that would bolster the CCP's image and position, evident in the 100 million who ... resided under CCP rule near Yan'an by 1945.",205

This policy aimed to utilise 'China's abundant surplus rural workers' (S15), which led to the production of 600 000 steel furnaces in the countryside. This was due to the success of the First Five Year Plan (1953-1957) which increased industrial output by 10-16% and Mao wanted to achieve such success on a larger scale. Therefore, the ruralisation of industry led to a significant change in which 100 million people were taken from farms to work on steel furnaces...",217

The First Five Year Plan had resulted in a mere 2-3% increase in agricultural production, and Mao wanted to 'increase both agricultural and industrial output by manifolds' (S15). This led to the collectivisation of work and life, including the construction of 26 000 communes, and the formation of 'work teams' of 150-600 people.

Humanities,Revolutions,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEHRERB,VCEHR25EQB1,VCEHRERBER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 1,StudentResponse,,"As the Articles of Confederation represented and enshrined key liberties for revolutionary Americans, their failure and replacement thus demonstrated a sacrifice of idealism to ensure the pragmatic survival of the new country. Initially, the Articles prioritised ... state power, where the delegation of roles including taxation was left to state legislatures. Consequently, the Continental Congress struggled to accrue funding ... [because it was] unable to implement federal taxes. This aligned with the key revolutionary principles, including of 'taxation without representation is tyranny' as espoused by Patrick Henry as Congress was unelected, but led to failures in the functioning of the Congress as a governing body. Alexander Hamilton observed that 'without certain revenues, government cannot function', when discussing the struggling financial situation of the colonies in 1780 where hyperinflation continued to depreciate colonial currency and challenge the ability of Congress to compensate revolutionary soldiers. Therefore, the exchange of the Articles for the development of a Constitution, which utilised federalist ideals to implement a stronger central government, demonstrated a departure from the prioritisation of revolutionary ideology above function. The feeling of ideals as being compromised by the Constitution was asserted by Patrick Henry, who claimed to 'smell a rat in Philadelphia ... tending towards monarchy' at the time of the Philadelphia Convention.

Humanities,Revolutions,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEHRERB,VCEHR25EQB2,VCEHRERBER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 2,StudentResponse,,"However, from 1793 onwards, the new regime's use of violence under the Reign of Terror significantly compromised many of the 1789 ideals. Though many revolutionaries had vocalised their belief in popular sovereignty, such as Robespierre contending that 'the people are never wrong' (February 1793), the announcement of 'let Terror be the order of the day' (Danton) on September 5 1793 acted to replace the popular sovereignty that the sans-culottes had expressed through violence, with state-sanctioned terror. Consequently, the National Convention would consolidate power through eliminating enemies of the revolution through violence, highlighting how 'violence was the motor of the revolution' (Schama). Despite having abolished the lettres de cachet on 16 March 1790 and the arbitrary justices employed by Louis XVI, the Law of Suspects (17 September 1793) reversed the ideal of justice as fair, as the Law led to arbitrary arrest and imprisonment, and wide definitions of 'suspects'. Furthermore, the convention consolidated power with the Law of 14 Frimaire granting them executive legislative power, betraying the desire for separation of power inspired by Montesquieu. Moreover, as a result of the Terror, the convention was able to brutally supress the Federalist Revolts, such as the Battle of Le Mans slaughtering 3000 of 5000 rebels at the Vendee, in part motivated by opposition to Paris's centralised authority and lack of regional autonomy. This marked 'the complete reversal of the principles of 1789' (Townson).",57

A political challenge to Bolshevik authority would present itself in the form of the Constituent Assembly. The Bolsheviks would respond to the threat, having lost the popular vote 52% to 24% to the SRs, on the 5th-6th by utilising Kronstadt sailors to force out the deputies at gunpoint, closing the assembly forever. Thus, despite not enacting ruthless violence, the Bolsheviks would respond to the first political challenge to their authority with the threat of political violence, introducing their regime's stance as oppressive and violent, as according to Pipes 'the machine gun became the principal instrument of political persuasion'. However, the Bolsheviks would respond to the next major challenge to their authority with unprecedented levels of violence. The Decree on Red Terror would be passed September 5th, 1918, a direct response to an SR challenge in the form of a failed assassination attempt on Lenin (Aug 30th by SR Kaplan) and to combat a divided society in the midst of the civil war... This decree would lead to the creation of over 318 concentration camps that would hold 70 000 class enemies by 1920 coupled with the murder of 50 000 Russian civilians by the CHEKA in 1918. In direct response to a direct violent threat to their authority, the Bolsheviks would aim to 'instill a sense of hopelessness in their enemies' (Trotsky). Terror would be deemed as an 'intrinsic part of revolution' by Lenin, as the Bolsheviks would utilise ruthless violence as the way to 'subjugate a society they could not control by any other means' according to Figes.",73

Humanities,Revolutions,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEHRERB,VCEHR25EQB4,VCEHRERBER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 4,StudentResponse,,"Arguably, personal ambition was most prominently demonstrated in Mao's later years, between 1962-1976, yet the principles of realising a socialist, new culture cannot be overlooked in driving the policies of the Socialist Education Movement (SEM) and Cultural Revolution (GPCR). Indeed, the question of legacy prompted Mao to embrace the emerging cult of personality formed in the early days of the Long March, and solidified in Lin Biao's May 1964 publication of Mao's Little Red Book. Mao's desire to 'identify himself in symbols that lived beyond him' (Fenby) drove the GPCR. Yet 'Mao's goal of mass dictatorship and continuous revolution' (Jalvin) simultaneously precipitated in the friction between himself and Liu Shaoqi during the 1962-63 SEM, as Mao emphasised 'bottom up' revolution to restore the economy and purge corrupt cadres post-Great Leap Forward, whilst Liu envisioned 'top down' purges. Subsequently, Mao's August 5 1966 declaration to 'Bombard the Headquarters' weaponised students as Red Guards to realise his ambition of 'permanent revolution', purging political enemies. Resultantly, by November 1967, 70-80% of party cadres had been purged... While this used 'idealistic youngsters [as] pawns in a power struggle' (Lynch), Mao also reasserted his belief in mass mobilisation that was at the crux of his ideology since Jiangxi Soviet days. As such, the events of the Cultural Revolution somewhat substantiate Mao's decisiveness to retain political supremacy, yet also coincided with his doctrine of 'the revolutionary mobilisation of the masses' (Zarrow) and class conflict.",88
