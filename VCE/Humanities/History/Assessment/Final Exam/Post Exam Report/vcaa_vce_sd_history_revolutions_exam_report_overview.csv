Humanities,History,VCEHRV,Revolutions,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEHRVER,VCEHRVERGC,General Comments,,"The 2024 VCE History: Revolutions examination was based on the accredited VCE History Study Design. It contained two sections. Section A, a source analysis, contained four questions, of which students were only required to answer two. In Section B, students were required to write an essay in response to one of four questions. The total marks awarded for this examination was 70.",,0
Humanities,History,VCEHRV,Revolutions,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEHRVER,VCEHRVERGC,General Comments,,"The vast majority of students were familiar with the format of the examination and completed the required number of sections. While most students chose two questions from Section A and one from Section B, a very small number of students chose to complete more than two questions from Section A, and in many of these cases, failed to attempt an essay from Section B. Typically, responses were fairly balanced between both sections of the examination. There was little to suggest that students were sacrificing time for one section over the other.",,1
Humanities,History,VCEHRV,Revolutions,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEHRVER,VCEHRVERGC,General Comments,,"Students were familiar with explicitly specifying the revolution they were writing about, and they effectively utilised the designated writing spaces. The lines provided beneath each question serve as a guide, indicating the expected amount of writing. It is not obligatory to extend into the additional writing space. However, when students did use the extra space, there was a clear indication in the initial booklet, as well as clearly labelled responses in that space. Navigating the Question and Answer Book is a vital skill for all History: Revolutions students and, overall, this was done well in 2024.",,2
Humanities,History,VCEHRV,Revolutions,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEHRVER,VCEHRVERGC,General Comments,,Some general observations and suggestions for improved performance in the written examination are as follows:,,3
Humanities,History,VCEHRV,Revolutions,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEHRVER,VCEHRVERGC,General Comments,,"For lower-order questions requiring students to 'identify' features, own knowledge is not required. Therefore, students should aim to clearly transcribe all source material and explicitly use quotation marks to indicate when a written feature of a source has been used. Dot points are sufficient for a two-mark 'identify' question.",,4
Humanities,History,VCEHRV,Revolutions,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEHRVER,VCEHRVERGC,General Comments,,"Students should make note of the text surrounding the visual sources, as it provides valuable information that can be utilised when addressing the question. In 2024, much of this information could be used to respond to part a. and/or b. questions in Section A.",,5
Humanities,History,VCEHRV,Revolutions,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEHRVER,VCEHRVERGC,General Comments,,"For medium-order questions, with command terms such as 'explain' and 'analyse', students were expected to provide multiple on-topic arguments that combined source material with their own knowledge. Responses that only transposed the source material did not score well here, as own knowledge was explicitly required. Similarly, responses that failed to explicitly reference the source material did not score well.",,6
Humanities,History,VCEHRV,Revolutions,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEHRVER,VCEHRVERGC,General Comments,,"When using the sources, explicit references should be used, for example, 'S11', 'Source 11', 'as seen in Source 11'.",,7
Humanities,History,VCEHRV,Revolutions,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEHRVER,VCEHRVERGC,General Comments,,'Explain' and 'analyse' questions typically focused on an individual or a group. Students were expected to contain their responses to that individual or group and not go beyond into discussing other figures/groups as their focal point of discussion.,,8
Humanities,History,VCEHRV,Revolutions,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEHRVER,VCEHRVERGC,General Comments,,"For higher-order extended response questions involving the 'evaluate' command term, a more comprehensive and structured response was necessary. According to the VCAA glossary of command terms, 'evaluate' requires students to provide a clear and reasoned judgment. The strongest responses demonstrated focus and precision, avoiding the temptation to merely recount historical details. Instead, these students crafted clear, relevant discussions that directly engaged with the specific requirements of the question.",,9
Humanities,History,VCEHRV,Revolutions,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEHRVER,VCEHRVERGC,General Comments,,"Essay questions demand thoughtful engagement with the prompt, requiring a thorough development of ideas supported by detailed own evidence. Direct reliance on source material from Section A is not appropriate in this context. While some students approached these questions successfully, overall performance varied. Many displayed extensive knowledge of the reasons for the outbreak of their revolutions, but many fell into the trap of narrating events in the post-revolutionary time period, rather than constructing on-topic analytical arguments.",,10
Humanities,History,VCEHRV,Revolutions,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEHRVER,VCEHRVERGC,General Comments,,Each essay question began with a prompt that needed to be explicitly addressed. Some responses abandoned discussion of the essay prompt and provided pre-prepared responses focusing on other causes of revolution without any meaningful connection to the question. These responses typically did not score well.,,11
Humanities,History,VCEHRV,Revolutions,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEHRVER,VCEHRVERGC,General Comments,,"To excel in the essay portion of the examination, responses should focus on presenting multiple relevant ideas and substantiating all arguments with well-chosen evidence.",,12
Humanities,History,VCEHRV,Revolutions,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEHRVER,VCEHRVERGC,General Comments,,"The student's 'own voice' should be apparent in the development of their arguments. The highest-scoring responses contained clear contentions relevant to the specific demands of the questions they were addressing. Responses that typified the mid and lower ranges heavily used either source material or historians as the basis for their arguments, lacking the clear unique contention that dominated the higher-scoring responses.",,13
Humanities,History,VCEHRV,Revolutions,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEHRVER,VCEHRVERGC,General Comments,,"The use of quotations by historians may be used throughout the examination when own knowledge or evidence is requested. However, students should aim to be measured and precise when utilising historical interpretations.",,14
Humanities,History,VCEHRV,Revolutions,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEHRVER,VCEHRVERGC,General Comments,,"General/generic quotations such as 'tensions flared', as well as single word quotes such as 'paralysed', indicate a lack of critical understanding of historical opinion.",,15
Humanities,History,VCEHRV,Revolutions,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEHRVER,VCEHRVERGC,General Comments,,"In some instances, students cited historians associated with a different revolution or applied historical interpretations outside their appropriate context. Such errors reflect a misunderstanding of the material and should be avoided to ensure accuracy and relevance in responses.",,16
Humanities,History,VCEHRV,Revolutions,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEHRVER,VCEHRVERGC,General Comments,,Higher-scoring responses were able to provide a combination of various forms of primary sources and historical interpretations as evidence and weaved this material throughout the development of their arguments.,,17
Humanities,History,VCEHRV,Revolutions,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEHRVER,VCEHRVERGC,General Comments,,The History Study Design clearly indicates the time period relevant to each revolution. Background information provided from outside these ranges are not acceptable forms of own knowledge and should be avoided. Examples include the arrival of British settlers to North America and the Qing dynasty's rule in China.,,18
Humanities,History,VCEHRV,Revolutions,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEHRVER,VCEHRVERSI,Specific information,,"Note: Student responses reproduced in this report have not been corrected for grammar, spelling or factual information.
