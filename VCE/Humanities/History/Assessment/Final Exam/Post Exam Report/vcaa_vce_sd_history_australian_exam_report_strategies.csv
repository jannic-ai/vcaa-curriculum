These questions were well-handled by the cohort, with most students successfully selecting two appropriate quotes from the written sources provided that addressed the question. Students may add their own words to label or categorise, for example, labelling complaints or reasons, and this can help to convey the meaning of their answer, but it was not necessary to score full marks.",,2
Humanities,Australian History,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEHUERA,,VCEHUERACM,,Section A - General Comments,ExaminerCommentary,"'Describe' questions were worth four marks and required students to provide detailed characteristics or features of two events or perspectives. Students were required to use the visual source provided to support their answer. Students are encouraged to read and draw on information that is provided with the source. Each visual source was accompanied by an introductory comment and attribution, and this extra information often provided important clues to help students interpret the source appropriately. Full sentences should be used for four-mark questions, rather than providing two events or perspectives as dot points.",,3
Humanities,Australian History,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEHUERA,,VCEHUERACM,,Section A - General Comments,ExaminerCommentary,"'Explain' questions were worth five or six marks and required students to make connections between causes and consequences. This required identifying the causes (e.g., British attitudes about the land, the Aboriginal Protection Act 1869 or the increase of government activity during World War II), identifying the consequences and providing reasons why the cause led to these consequences (e.g., the colonisation of Australia, the impacts of the Aboriginal Protection Act 1869 or the economic and social life of Australia during World War II).",,4

Students should address the question term and subject and use the source provided as evidence. The source itself is not the answer and simply summarising the source was not enough to achieve full marks. Students were required to quote key phrases or words from the source, and higher-scoring responses placed such quotes into an argument and explained their relevance to the question.",,5

Higher-scoring responses often clearly signposted an answer by identifying when the second event or perspective was being discussed and naming the event or perspective when appropriate. Such structure helped keep responses relevant and concise. Descriptions and explanations of perspectives often identified the idea or argument that underpinned the perspective along with examples or evidence of such perspectives.",,6

These questions required students to establish relationships between components (e.g., protest and changes to government policy relating to the environment) and the significance of these relationships. Although examples of the relationship between components were required (e.g., of the impact of the Save Our Sons campaign and the Moratorium Movement on attitudes towards participation in the Vietnam War), it was appropriate to argue that such relationships were limited and to provide reasons for this argument, which many students did.",,7

After colonisation, pastoralism was introduced to the Australian environment with sheep compacting the solid and changing 'the very nature of the country' (Lines). Additionally, a century later Australians wished to utilise the land to its utmost capabilities and so in 1890 sought to irrigate the Murray River in order to occupy the unused land along its banks. In 1890 the Chaffey family brought the areas around the Murray from 'desert wild to fruitful pains' (s2) with their irrigation.",22

Source 3 suggests that such attitudes stemmed from the Bible command 'to go forth and multiply and subdue the earth' and the belief that Aboriginal peoples were not using the land, which left it open and available to those willing to use it (according to European understandings of land use). Furthermore, the source describes Europeans' feelings of superiority over Aboriginal peoples during this period through the quote 'He allows the superiority of civilisation over barbarism, of intellect over instinct or brutish reason' and that this, too, was used as justification for colonisation.",,23

These responses sometimes also discussed how Europeans' understanding of land ownership was linked to the idea that land was to be exploited and profited from, as justification for colonisation of the land.",,24
Humanities,Australian History,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEHUERA,VCEHU24EQA1,VCEHUERAER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 1c,StudentResponse,The following is an example of a high-scoring response:,"British attitudes surrounding the land largely centred on its utilisation for commercial opportunities. They believed that the Indigenous people had 'wasted' its potential as a highly profitable location for resource exploitation. Colonisers' bemusement at the Indigenous' lack of exploitation of the land is epitomised by James Cook's 1770 quote, 'we saw not one inch of cultivated land in the whole country'. The British's capitalistic mindset that land was not created by 'God' 'as a beautiful spectacle ... but as a field to be improved upon' exemplifies not only their reasons for settlement, but the reasoning behind the way in which they settled. Instantly pursuing the profitability of the Australian landscape, colonisers grazed the land and grazed sheep, fuelled by this notion of 'improvement'. Ultimately, British attitudes in the form of religion and the Doctrine of Land Improvement were integral to their colonisation of Australia.",25

Humanities,Australian History,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEHUERA,VCEHU24EQA1,VCEHUERAER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 1d,StudentResponse,The following is an example of a high-scoring response:,"Australians' views of the environment were influenced by perspectives of conservation and ideas of economic growth. Perspectives prioritising conservation of the environment were influential by warning of the 'further degradation of land and water resources' (s4), if the pathway of disregarding the damage to the environment continued. The views centred around protecting the natural landscape and stopping its manipulation as it 'compromise[s] its quality of life' (s4) sparked a shift in Australian views to push for conservation. Writings like Rachel Carson's Silent Spring (1962) and Barry Commoner's 'Four Laws of Ecology' (1971) were influential in changing views of the environment as they showed that 'every gain is won at some cost'. Additionally, perspectives focused on the nation's economic growth also influenced views. The belief of mining industries and CEOs like Hugh Morgan that mining is the 'dynamo of the economy' (Blainey) influenced support of mining and views disregarding environmental damage. The perspective that economic growth was more important than conservation was echoed with views that 'mining bans would constitute a negligent disregard to vast mineral wealth' (Lines), influencing views of using the land as a commodity.",32

Higher-scoring responses often differentiated between changes to government policy at the state or federal levels or argued that although some protests led to changes to government policy such as the introduction of the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act 1983, many protests were unsuccessful or had limited impacts on government policy.

Hutton and Canners note the Bans 'ignited enthusiasm' for environmental issues 'across the nation', with the first Green Ban in 1970 saving Kelly's Bush from development. Yet beyond this, the protests influenced policy, with Australia ratifying the World Heritage Convention in 1949, now having enlisted over 20 sites. Further, the bans saw an agreement with the government for 90 per cent of historic homes to be renovated, rather than completely knocked down, pointing to how government policy was changed by 2010.",40

The source provided referred to the prevalent belief during the closing decades of the 19th century that Aboriginal peoples were a primitive race who were 'doomed to disappear'. Furthermore, the source noted that legislation modelled on the Victorian Aboriginal Protection Act 1869 was passed in all major colonies or states. High-scoring responses identified how the law functioned through the establishment of a Central Board that had total control over the lives of Aboriginal peoples in Victoria. The Board determined where Aboriginal peoples could live, how they were employed, how their earnings were spent and how their children were cared for and educated. Additional consequences of the law described by students often included that Aboriginal peoples frequently lost access to hunting and culturally significant lands and that the Act undermined Aboriginal traditions and rituals. Some responses described how the Act normalised racist attitudes towards Aboriginal peoples, became a precedent for other laws around Australia and contributed to the passing of the Half-Caste Act of 1886, which split families living on the reserves. Some responses also noted that the inspector and manager of the Kulin people at Coranderrk, John Green, often acted with more humanity than other managers and allowed the people there to rule themselves as much as possible.

This increased dispossession of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as this gave legitimacy to them being regarded as 'uncivilised ... less than human', according to historian David Day. Secondly, the Act established 'greater regulatory powers' of the government of Indigenous people (s7). This gave the government significantly greater powers over where Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people lived and worked, acting as a form of discrimination. Lastly, the Act normalised racism in the colonies, as demonstrated by William Hull, a member of the Victorian Parliament at the time, who stated, 'the inferior races should pass away before the superior races', demonstrating bigotry.",57

High-scoring responses often noted how Australian participation in the conflict influenced attitudes towards those fleeing communism and distinguished between the approaches of Prime Minister Gough Whitlam and his successor Malcolm Fraser, who spearheaded two refugee conferences in 1978-1979, creating an international agreement for refugee resettlement. Higher-scoring responses also connected the two key events described to changes to both immigration and citizenship; either both events could be linked to both concepts or one event could be linked to each.

It will continue to be a British community.' Yet, following the threats of invasion from Japan and the unprepared response, a change occurred where immigrants were viewed as a necessity for 'Australia to hold our island continent for ourselves' (Calwell). This resulted in the Chifley government introducing the 'populate or perish' slogan, where assisted migration saw two million migrants between 1945 and 1965, many of whom were British as part of the '10-pound pom scheme'. This shift in attitudes towards necessity saw more lenient immigration, with 120,000 displaced Europeans beyond the British Isles coming to Australia by 1951, and received bipartisan support with opposition leader Robert Menzies stating, 'we must view migrants primarily as assets'. This culminated in a growing acceptance of immigration, reinforced by Al Grassby's declaration of multiculturalism in 1973.",72

This attitude is reflected in Pauline Hanson's maiden speech, where she stated, 'I believe we are in danger of being swamped by Asians'.

This was the first well-known attempt to claim land title over non-reserve land, advocating 'morally the land' was theirs and 'should be returned' to them. Ultimately, a lease of 33,000 km squared was granted to the Gurindji in 1972, with a symbolic hand back in 1975.

The idea of feminism was often defined by students as the pursuit of equality, particularly in economic and social experiences during the 20th century.

By 1961, the contraceptive pill was introduced which 'became a symbol of the sexual revolution' (Bongiorno) as it enabled sexual liberation for women. Therefore, women 'delayed childbearing' (Bongiorno) and became more involved in the workforce. In addition, the 'Bar room Suffragettes' (1965) challenged the idea that only men belonged in social spheres. This protest marked a feminine desire for equality which was considered a 'threat to sanctity and virtuous form of womanhood' (Dever) that was endorsed through 'domesticity and sobriety' (Dever). Moreover, the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 was a legislative reform that suppressed the marginalisation imposed upon women. According to historian Grimshaw, this Act transformed how 'Australians viewed women's roles in society', instead, striving towards 'fairness' and 'inclusivity'.

Indeed, this event was considered the 'most dramatic moment of backlash' (Willett), although it evolved into one of the world's largest LGBTQIA+ parades (Pride History group). Hence gay rights became more embraced by a society that previously suppressed their existence. In addition, the HIV/AIDS pandemic prompted further recognition of the homosexual community.

The 'domino theory' inspired a wave of fear that communist 'military operations' would translate into a takeover. Therefore, Prime Minister Menzies considered the spread of communism as a threat to regional security, where its existence could come 'hundreds of miles nearer to us'. According to historian Edwards, the Australian Government magnified a 'climate of fear' to 'justify restrictive measures' and military involvement. Moreover, Australia participated in the Vietnam War to uphold its alliance with the United States. Indeed, the ANZUS Treaty functioned to justify military action, and provided security in a region paralysed by 'fear and uncertainty'. Thus, Australia fought to strengthen its 'relationship with the United States' (Edwards) by being actively involved in the Vietnam [War] to suppress 'communist influence' and to ensure American support if required in the future.",129

Many students argued that the SOS campaign and the Moratorium Movement had some impact in changing attitudes towards the use of conscripted soldiers in Vietnam and Australian military participation in the conflict more broadly. The SOS campaign stimulated strong reactions from the public, both positive and negative, using strategies such as sit-ins, vigils and education campaigns, which raised awareness, highlighted the human cost of the war and played some part in shifting attitudes. Similarly, the Moratorium Movement brought together a broad cross-section of the Australian public, highlighting how widespread the opposition movement was and creating a sense of solidarity. By contrast, some students argued that these movements were more a reflection of attitudes that already existed, placing them in the context of broader anti-conscription or anti-war movements, or that the impact of these movements was actually quite limited. Students who pursued this line of argument explained an alternative factor (e.g., the impact of the Tet Offensive or media coverage prior to 1970) that demonstrates why the impact of these movements was limited, and this argument was considered acceptable for this question.",,130

The Save Our Sons movement, established in 1965, showcased anti-conscription sentiment of the time. However, Michael Caulfield states that SOS women were 'called communists [and] bad mothers' and, as such, were not entirely influential to those already for the war. Rather, significant events within the war shaped changing perspectives. The 1968 Tet Offensive was considered that 'catalyst for the media's shift' on war (Ashley Ekins). Further, the My Lai crisis of 1968 was considered by many as 'brutal and indiscriminate' (Cairns), leading to increased opposition to war. Such events in turn led to the Moratorium Movements of 1970, led by Jim Cairns. The hundreds of thousands of people protesting was a clear display of anti-war sentiment resulting from such crises. This movement did bolster the arguments by the SOS that the war was 'inhumane' (Jean McLean) and wrong, by uniting those against the war as a group. However, it did not singularly change perspectives towards the war involvement. Further, pro-war perspectives still remained to an extent, with the government not entirely withdrawing until 1972. While the SOS and Moratorium Movement had some impact on perspectives towards war, it was events within the war that largely shifted perspectives.

Based upon the premise of the Doctrine of Land Improvement, Europeans believed that Australian land must be utilised for its profitability and commercial opportunities. Thus, in 1797, Merino sheep were introduced to Australia, whose land John Batman described as 'the most beautiful sheep pasturage I ever saw'. The introduction of sheep grazing saw 'squatters', those who illegally claimed land, venture across Eastern Australia in pursuit of a location to raise sheep. Thus, by 1850, there were over six million sheep in Australia, producing around 1 million pounds worth of wool per year. The extensive grazing of sheep saw many native species decline in population with 'the nutritious root [murrnong root] greatly diminishing due to the grazing of sheep and cattle' (Reynolds). Furthermore, the grazing of sheep on 'soil which had never felt hooved feet caused great erosion and created dust'. Ultimately, pastoralism and the introduction of sheep in Australia caused permanent damage to the Australian landscape, inhibiting the longevity of native plants as well as destroying the fertile soil on which they grazed.",16

Discovered in 1851, the obvious resource exploitation by the Europeans permanently the landscape of the mining fields. One of its main, obvious physical alterations was the 'creation of great and vast holes' around mining areas such as Ballarat and Bendigo. Potentially the more influential impact of the gold rush was the unprecedented influx of foreigners into Australia, all in pursuit of gold. In 1851, the year gold was first discovered in Victoria, its population was 77,000, but in 1861, Victoria's population had multiplied nearly seven times, reaching 540,000. With the mass influx of foreigners came an increase in demand, requiring a major increase in resource extraction. Following the gold rush, Melbourne was logging over four million trees per year for solely firewood, outlining the profound environmental effects of the gold rush on the environment. The extensive damage attributed to the mining of gold, as well as the exponential increase in resource exploitation as a result of the gold rush, exemplifies the extensive change made to the land by European colonists.",17

Labelled the 'most intense frontier conflict in Australian history' (Clements), the 'Black War' in Van Diemen's Land spanned from 1824 to 1831. Epitomising the major destruction of Indigenous culture and custodianship, the conflict killed over 1000 people. In an attempt to eliminate the Palawa people, colonists implemented a manoeuvre labelled 'the Black Line', but were outsmarted due to the Palawa people's deep-rooted knowledge of the local bushland. Subsequently, the 'Black War' had the lowest black to white death ratio of four to one in all frontier conflicts, reflecting the tenacity of the Palawa resistance. Despite their best efforts, the Palawa people suffered more than 800 casualties, reducing their culture and preservation of traditions to a small number of people. Unfortunately, the occurrence of loss of culture was common as a result of the Frontier Wars, with an estimated 20,000-30,000 Indigenous men, women and children killed across Australia. Ultimately, the high casualty rate and overall denouncement of Indigenous people from colonisers caused profound reductions in the preservation of culture and custodianship.

Firstly, in 1890, NSW Premier Henry Parkes reiterated that Australia was a 'crimson threat of kinship with Great Britain and this exemplified Australia's desire to be synonymous with Britain and its European characteristics. Thus, this somewhat influenced Australia's anti non-European immigrant sentiment. Secondly, Australia was federated and created with Great Britain in mind as the January 1901 Federation parade was, according to Eric Idle, 'overwhelmingly British'. This insinuates that the 1901 Immigration Restriction Act was somewhat influenced by Britain which developed greater negative attitudes towards non-white migrants. Thirdly, Britain recommended to Australia that the nation use the Dictation Test to most effectively turn away non-European immigrants. This influenced most prejudicial attitudes and actions towards immigration processes as by 1909, 1359 immigrants had taken the test and only 52 had passed.

Firstly, in 1852 Latrobe announced that immigrants should be 'owing no allegiance to Britain'. This underscores how Australia's growing national identity created greater acceptance of migrants becoming 'Australian' and not 'British'. Secondly, in the 1880s, an Australian journalist by the name of Goodge argued that Australia 'must be a white man's country'. This exemplifies how Australia's growing identity was a significant factor influencing most discriminatory attitudes towards immigration. Thirdly, invasion novels began to become prevalent in the 1880s also as Australians became fearful of invasion by the Chinese; according to Stuart Macintyre, 'the Australian nation was swayed by the fear of invasion'. In 1887, the novel White or Yellow was produced about a futuristic race war between Australia and Chinese.

These anti-Chinese sentiments set a precedent for the following decades and engendered great prejudiced attitudes towards non-white immigrants; as a prominent Chinese immigrant commented on these discriminatory attitudes, 'there is injustice' (Lowe Kong Meng). Secondly, the 1901 Immigration Restriction Act was termed by Alfred Deakin 'the policy of securing a white Australia'.

Influenced by ideas of Chartism, originating in Britain in the 1830s, white male workers challenged the power of the squattocracy. Fuelled by the poor political representation and little agency on the goldfields, men experienced improvements in their lives through protest. The enforcement of a 30 shilling a month mining licence designed to 'oppress, entrap and emasculate men' (Wright) sparked the 1854 Eureka Stockade. The stockade helped broaden the rights for white men a part of lower classes by resulting in male suffrage for white men by 1860 (encompassing the abolishment of property and wealth qualifications). Additionally, 'the creation of a political party out of the existing industrial defeat' (Macintyre) further challenged the exercise of power by employers as the formation of the Australian Labor Party in 1901 affirmed the idea of the nation as a 'workingman's paradise' by passing democratic reforms, improving the rights of workers. The 1904 Conciliation and Arbitration Act 'multiplied the opportunities of the masses' (Deakin) and advanced the rights of white men by providing them with an opportunity to negotiate wages with workers. Furthermore, the 1907 Harvester Judgement further progressed the rights of white men as the decision offered a basic wage of 7 shillings per day for a 6-day week. This achievement was a 21 per cent increase in wages commonly paid to unskilled workers and thus challenged the power of upper echelons.

The idea that the right to vote would 'take away from the charm and beauty of women and cause them to neglect their domestic duties' (Glassey) was dismantled with the extension of the right to vote to white women. The 'simple act of justice' (Smith) changed the exercise of power by providing women with a voice in the public domain, something they lacked. The enfranchisement of women improved their rights and living conditions as before franchise, the infant mortality rate was 111 deaths per 1000 babies, a decade later this dropped to 77 deaths. The vote 'offered women a more equitable place within family law, advanced educational opportunities and increased employment choices' (Grimshaw). However, in challenging the exercise of power, through the gaining of the vote, women's rights for equal pay were diminished with the 1912 Fruit Picker's Judgement. The judgement saw 'the ability of women to achieve a fair wage ... dealt a sore blow' (Grimshaw), with the basic wage of women set at 54 per cent of the basic male wage. This failed to change the exercise of power held by men, reinforcing the idea of the man as the breadwinner.

The purpose of the Act to limit foreign immigration enabled the 'higher races to increase and live freely for higher civilisation' (Barton). Through the federation of Australia, Aboriginal peoples were excluded from being counted in the census under section 127 and prevented the Commonwealth Government from making laws specific to Aboriginal peoples under section 51 (xxvi).

World War I was an opportunity for the newly federated Australia to prove its worthiness as a key member of the British Empire, and in 1939, World War II seemed to present a similar chance. However, when Australians came to know the threat of invasion on its own shores, tension strained the previously unyielding military alliance as Australia turned to the United States. Yet, whilst Australia gained a crucial military alliance in the US, the nation remained steadfastly loyal to the British Empire.",41
Humanities,Australian History,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEHUERB,VCEHU24EQB4,VCEHUERBER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 4,StudentResponse,,"The outbreak of World War I in 1914 prompted the immediate response of the parliament, in which both the government and the opposition pledged Australia's allegiance to Britain. Soon to be Prime Minister Andrew Fisher stated that Australia would defend Britain to the 'last man and the last shilling' in his 1914 election speech. Many Australians at this time still regarded Great Britain as the 'Mother Country', and so patriotism and loyalty were on full display, as the nation felt great enthusiasm to defend their 'homeland'. The unwavering loyalty to Britain is evident, as Australia's war effort from 1914 to 1918 was entirely voluntary, despite the efforts of PM Billy Hughes to introduce conscription in the referenda of 1916 and 1917. Such sentiment of strong patriotism was evident in official propaganda such as 'The Trumpet Calls', 'Show the enemy what Australian sporting men can do' and 'Australia has promised Britain 50,000 more men', successfully intertwining images of Australian national identity like sports and kangaroos with obligations to the British Empire to convince men to enlist. Australia's affiliation with Great Britain maintained an entirely voluntary war effort sent to aid Britain; historian David Day additionally interpreted that Australia was 'convinced that its fate rested on Britain', the fear of a German conquering further exhibiting the nation's concern and devoted defence of the British Empire's security.",42

With the memories of hardship, shortages and bereavement still raw from WWI, historian Kate Darian-Smith discovered that there was 'a general sense of foreboding', a stark contrast to the farewell parades and excitement of 1914. Yet Australia once again displayed great support for the Empire, shipping off Australian Imperial Force troops in January 1940 for the British Empire. Up until December 1941, Australia's war effort was largely motivated by defending the security of their ruling British Empire; however, when the Japanese entered the war, creating a new theatre of war in Australia's home Pacific region, the nation's motivation for participation transformed and loyalties expanded beyond Great Britain.",43

Australia in 1941 was only 40 per cent ready to fight a war (Adcock et al.) and so PM John Curtin turned to the nation's primary military alliance for desperate aid. This is where tension cooled the alliance between Britain and Australia; the Telegram War of 1942 revealing PM Curtin's plea for aid and the return of Australian troops and British PM Winston Churchill's inability to provide or return troops as the war escalated in Europe. The military alliance lost reciprocity and with Australia's full attention now on its own national security, PM Curtin announced in 1942 'Australia now looks to America' and 'we will not be left quite alone'. The new military alliance with the US was a mutually beneficial forging, as PM Curtin desperately required troops to defend an unprepared Australia and the United States desired a base in the Pacific from which to repel Japanese expansion. The latter part of WWII witnessed Australia focus militarily on its own national and regional security rather than that of the British Empire.",44

Most students used the source to explain that the Dreaming is central to Aboriginal religion and that it has two rules: 'obey the Law and leave the world as you found it...'. This is because creator ancestors made the land; people see evidence of the Dreaming in the land, sea and sky; and 'every hill, plain, rock and tree is alive with story and imagery and filled with presences'. Furthermore, the source argues that 'within the perception of living generations generally they succeeded' in conserving the natural environment in accordance with their religion. Higher-scoring responses, however, argued that Aboriginal peoples also employed strategies such as using fire, hydraulic engineering and stone quarrying to manage and shape the natural environment, and therefore they did make changes to the environment over longer periods of time in sustainable ways.

By 1992 multiculturalism had both been institutionalised and widely accepted as a strength of Australian society. However, the re-emergence of security concerns regarding refugees and asylum seekers amplified perspectives of conservative figures who opposed immigration, such as John Howard who declared 'we will decide who comes into this country and the circumstances in which they come'. As well, Pauline Hanson's claim in her 1996 maiden speech to parliament that 'Australia was being swamped by Asians' exemplified the impact security concerns had on desires for more restrictive immigration policy. These fearful and opposing perspectives led to the subsequent implementation of restrictive legislation such as the 2001 Pacific Solution, a direct result of the 2001 Tampa Affair. Although opposing perspectives rooted in security concerns prevailed between 1992 and 2008, so too did progressive perspectives which believed Australia should adopt a more humanitarian approach to border security.

Higher-scoring responses tended to use the source effectively for both lines of argument, noting that the Harvester Judgement created a male basic wage that was sufficient to support the needs of a family, but also that this wage was for a male breadwinner and such a rate was not extended to women, who continued to fight the 'dual standard' over the next 60 years. In addition to these lines of argument, high-scoring responses noted other improvements such as the creation of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, and the formation and early success of Labor parties in the colonies (later states) and federally. By contrast, many responses noted that the experiences of women workers did not improve by the same degree (although there was some economic progress for some groups) and Aboriginal workers often experienced continuities of working conditions or even a decline in conditions following Federation. In order to score full marks, responses needed to include some knowledge of the period before and the period after Federation.

Political movements such as Chartism and unionism encouraged a fight to improve the experience of workers. According to W.G. Spence 'unions came to the Australian bushman like a religion'. This movement was crucial in urging constant rebellion against systems that worsened the livelihoods of Australian workers, illustrated by the 1891 Queensland Shearers strike. This strike signified the ongoing struggle against employers, essential to improve experience. Whilst the 8 hour day had been achieved, the minimum wage was still not available for all workers. The Harvester Judgement in 1907, where Henry Higgins 'determined that a [fair and reasonable] wage should be sufficient to maintain a man' demonstrated how unions could battle struggles of capitalism which worsened their daily experience. This minimum wage allowed male workers to provide for a family and cover 'cost[s] of having clothing, food, transport' (source 10). This achieved the struggles of Australian male workers and promoted the egalitarian 'working man's paradise' (Prat et al, 2022) where fair livelihoods were achieved. However, the egalitarian society was not extended to women, who were excluded from the minimum wage as they were not considered breadwinners. Source 10 states that women contested the dual standard for the next 60 years', demonstrating the disadvantages of many women and how their experiences were worse off than male workers. The Fruit Pickers judgement in 1912 only allowed women in same industry as men to receive the same wage, otherwise they would only achieved 54% of their male counterpart's wage. Thus, whilst experiences of male workers improved between 1890 and 1913, women's experiences largely stayed the same.",55

The subsequent political 'swift' (Willett) backlash and favourable press coverage resulted in the subsequent decriminalisation of homosexuality in New South Wales by 1984, thus challenging this existing authority.

At the end of 1915, then PM Billy Hughes of the Labor Party promised Britain 50 000 more troops to help the British war effort. Although Australian enlistment numbers had spiked in 1915, with just over 160 000 men enlisting, this had begun to steadily decline, as the horrors of war became apparent. Hughes felt for Australia to fulfil its promise, conscription for overseas service must be enforced. A plebiscite on the issue was introduced in 1916 to the Australian people on the issue, beginning a period with some of the most 'savage disputes in Australian history' (Gammage). This 1916 referendum failed narrowly with 51% voting against it. Similarly in 1917, the referendum failed with 54% voting against it. This issue 'divided Australia' (s14). However, in WW2 with the increased direct threat of attack by Japan, conscription for overseas service gained greater support. On 1 January 1940 the Universal Service Scheme was implemented by the Menzies government, forcing men turning 21 to do three months training with the Citizen Militia Forces. However, more significantly, 'in January 1943 Curtin was authorised by his party to make the appropriate amendment to the Defence Act' (s14).

These enduring attitudes culminated in the changes in 1992. The first war that the last discriminatory policy of the Defence Act - which excluded Indigenous Australians from compulsory service - was removed. Secondly, Aboriginal servicemen in the Northern Territory Special Reconnaissance Unit in WW2 were formally recognised with back pay and medals. This reflected the idea of Aboriginal people being celebrated and acknowledged for their participation in the armed services, which had been denied to Indigenous veterans in both WW1 and WW2. Similarly, women underwent comprehensive changes in these years. The Women's Auxiliary Units had been disbanded in the 1970s, with women in the service being able to join the army in the same units as males. For instance, the Women's Royal Auxiliary Naval Service was disbanded to become part of the broader navy service. This reflected a significant shift in perspectives about women's participation, as people began to recognise women as capable individuals that could serve Australia alongside their male counterparts.

Essentially, they would reap the land of the resources they needed, and in return, care for and cultivate the land. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's connection to the land was also spiritual, as many had 'totems', which would often entail being unable to hunt or eat certain animals. Aboriginal custodians used a variety of land management techniques such as cultural burning, hydraulic engineering and stone quarrying, which utilised the land's natural resources in efficient and non-wasteful manners to acquire food. Through their impact on the land most notably recognised in their impact upon the resistance of many plants to fire as a result of cultural burning, Aboriginal land management practices allowed the land to maintain its lush and fertile nature, as evidenced by Captain James Cook's observation in 1770, where he documented having 'never saw an inch of cultivated land in the whole country'. Taken together, Aboriginal people perceived land as both a resource and an element to be cared for.",6
Humanities,Australian History,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEHUERB,VCEHU25EQB1,VCEHUERBER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 1,StudentResponse,,"Colonial perspectives of land differed vastly to Aboriginal beliefs in custodianship and care for country. Many of Australia's resources were wastefully farmed and perceived as existing for the purpose of financial gain. By 1844, Crown Lands Commissioner Foster Fyans noted that 'the destruction of fine timber in every part where it is to be found is really worthy of notice', demonstrating the detrimental effect of colonial presence on the land in fewer than 50 years. While they did believe in land ownership, it differed from the Aboriginal belief of collective ownership and custodianship of land. Instead, setter perspectives of land were driven by the bible, which suggested that land and its resources existed for the benefit of man. In 1987, historian Keith Thomas summarised these beliefs as such 'human civilisation indeed was virtually synonymous with the conquest of nature', and 'man's authority over the natural world was thus virtually unlimited'. Nonetheless, European settlers also acknowledged the value of land for its aesthetic purposes. In 1879, the first Australian national park (and the second in the world after Yellowstone) was established in New South Wales, in alignment with the increasing presence of tourism. Historian Julia Thorne described settler ideas of viewing nature as being 'a source of inspiration and enlightenment'. She suggests that to be able to view and experience beautiful natural sights was a 'pursuit of wonder' and 'a matter of civic pride'. Thus, while colonial perspectives of land were largely driven by the desire to exploit it for profit, they also perceived land as important for its aesthetic purposes.",7
Humanities,Australian History,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEHUERB,VCEHU25EQB1,VCEHUERBER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 1,StudentResponse,,"In the 20th century, namely from 1950 to 2010, perspectives of the use of land experienced a considerable shift from land as a resource to be exploited to natural habitats that were in need of protection. The Little Desert campaign was among the first of the environmental campaigns, and significantly, as historian Libby Robin describes in 1998, 'was one of the first wilderness battles' that did not focus on a scenically remarkable area. The primary struggle of the protesters was to emphasise the value of conservation sites beyond their aesthetic purpose. Later environmental campaigns such as the Franklin Dam Campaign (1977-1983) also acknowledged the value of land as a historic Aboriginal site. Along the river existed the Kutikina Caves which significantly housed ancient Aboriginal memories. Thus, 20th century perspectives of land reintroduced the value of land in relation to Aboriginal custodianship. In 1991, the Aboriginal Land Act was passed and in 1992, so was the Mabo decision, which in effect, denounced the terra nullius claim of 'land belonging to no-one'. For white Australians however the environmental movements presented new perspectives of relationships with land. Historian Frank Bongiorno wrote of the Franklin campaign in 2015 as '[signalling] for white Australians a new way of relating to place' that extended beyond colonist views of land. The formation of the Greens party following this campaign demonstrated the increased importance of the protection of the environmental and ecological preservation within the political landscape. Australia's presence at the Earth Summit in 1992 and Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's ratification of the Kyoto Protocol in 2007 further demonstrated the increasing value of environmental protection in both the policies of governments, and in the public consciousness. Historian Geoffrey Blainey summarises 20th century views of land as such; 'for the first time, Australians don't see undeveloped land as a sin and rapid population growth as a saviour'.",8

Responses typically engaged well with this premise, describing and comparing the benefits of immigration to Australian society and to the migrants themselves at different points in time, typically finding, on balance, that it is society that has benefited more from the experience. Many responses argued that mass migration during the gold rush era brought economic benefits and Chartist ideals, whereas many gold rush migrants were disappointed by the outcomes of their endeavours. By contrast, many living in Australia in the latter stages of the 19th century enjoyed high standards of living compared to those in other parts of the world. Similarly, responses tended to argue that Australia benefited from migration following World War II when the belief was that the country needed to 'populate or perish', although migrants themselves benefited from the security and freedom they experienced in Australia. Both the economy and migrants benefited from the Snowy Hydro project. While Australia's refugee intake increased following the Vietnam War, many responses noted the growing levels of prejudice experienced by migrants in the latter parts of the 20th century.",,10

Although early colonial migration saw benefits, generated from migration exclusively, applied to the existing, dominant society. The influx of migrants stimulated by the gold rush in the 1850s saw radical democratic reform that benefited exclusively the white, male society. In contrast, the necessitated broadening of migrant intake following WWII saw both society and the new arrived migrant population benefit substantially. Finally, the progressive abolishment of the White Australia policy, enabling uninhibited immigrant intake, facilitated a degrading cohesion, and this did not initially benefit society or the migrants",11

Following Edward Hargreaves discovery of gold in Bathurst in 1851, an influx of primarily young, white British males immigrated toward Australia - carrying the ideals of British Chartist movement, a large majority of the 600 000 found themselves subject to 'the tyranny of a governmental exploitation' (Hummfray) through the mining license fee imposed in 1851. As a result, the Ballarat Reform League under John Hummfray, established themselves in 1853 as a movement towards attaining 'the inalienable right of every citizen to have a voice' (Charter), calling on the American ideas of 'taxation with representation' and a universal, anonymous ballot. Following the culmination of disillusionment, manifested in the Eureka Stockade on the 3rd December 1854, the Legislative Assembly of Victoria passed the Electoral Acts of 1855 and 1856, granting universal and secret suffrage. Although providing an immense benefit of 'radical democratic progression' (Bolton), and seeing the 'the highest wages in the world' (Dingle), such benefits were limited to the white male population, disregarding the women and Chinese immigrants who remained disenfranchised and subject to discrimination. Indeed, although the gold rush facilitated 'sandstone palaces ... the great Melbourne Library' (Hunt) and painted Australia as 'democratic pace setters for the world' (Wright), it reduced the marginalised even more, creating 'a ruinous inundation' (Macintyre). As such, although the migrant influx of the gold rush brought immense economic and political benefit to the white, male society, it reinforced gender codes (Tavan) and 'solidified' the division between the British and the Chinese, thus benefiting a portion of society.",12

Immigration minister, Arthur Calwell's claim that 'the flag of the White Australian policy will not be lowered' following WWII, saw the gentle loosening of restrictions to enable 'Balts' and eastern Europeans into Australia, and equally over 120 000 displaced persons by 1951. Although social divisions born of the 'obsession with racial purity' (Day) lingered between the incoming Europeans and existing Australian society, it was the 'mineral discoveries of the 50s and 60s' and subsequent 'development binge' (Day) that facilitated smoother integration. With over 65 000 immigrants operating on the Snowy Hydro Scheme from 1948, which powered the 'industrial and developmental boom of the 60s' (Day), and unemployment dropped to 3% by 1960, 'unemployment became a fear of the distance pre-war past' (Day), and Australia was afforded 'prosperous complacency' (Bolton). Additionally, with over 55 000 immigrants working on Sydney's highway development becoming 'a striking symbol of Sydney's growth and maturity' (Day), the benefits delivered by the broadening of immigrant intake 'overcoming prejudice by careful selection' (W.D. Forsyth), were now applicable for both the existing society and the new wave of immigrants as 'owning a house... a car ... once luxuries, was now normal' (Carrodus). As such, the developmental boom born from the increased immigration intake of the 1950s enabled such benefits to apply to both the dominant 'Australian-Briton' society and the incoming migrants of eastern and southern European origin.",13

Following the 1958 Migration Act which removed the archaic dictation test which 'tainted our good name in the eyes of the world' (Downer), and Hubert Opperman's 1966 Migration Act which formally ended the White Australia Policy, the efforts of Al Grassby and Gough Whitlam to facilitate a cosmopolitan society including free university for all citizens, induced an economic downturn. Although initially support for Grassby's claims that the 'White Australia policy is dead' and that 'I want to be proud in any language to say I am Australian' was broad, the stagflation of the 1970s facilitated a new wave of anti-immigration. Labelling Australia 'a coffee coloured mess', institutions such as the Immigration Control Association relit rhetoric that discriminated against the now diverse immigrant intake. These effects compounded, with Geoffrey Blainey noting in 1984 that 'we have now turned the White Australia policy inside out', which gave a voice to a hive of resentment that felt that increased immigration was the cause of such economic struggles. This rhetoric was further compounded through the 1990s with Hanson noting 'we are in danger of being swamped by Asians', and Prime Minister John Howard noting 'the rate of Asian immigration should be slowed', indicating that migration not only was blamed for the worsening of Australia's economy, but immigrants equally faced discrimination of being scapegoats for worsening economic effects.",14

This was the most commonly chosen essay topic. In reference to the earlier time period, most responses described either the diminishment of power for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as a result of colonisation or how the impact of their ongoing violent resistance slowed the process of colonisation and caused fear. Furthermore, some higher-scoring responses noted that the outcome of the Myall Creek murders case reflected a shift in power and authority when European men were hanged for the murders of Aboriginal people. Similarly, some higher-scoring responses noted the damaging impact of colonial laws during the 19th century such as the Aboriginal Protection Act 1869 in Victoria. When analysing the second time period, students were able to describe key court findings such as Mabo or Wik, in addition to legislative changes such as the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 and the Native Title Act 1993, and some higher-scoring responses noted that legislation was used to wind back Aboriginal power and authority, for example, through the Native Title Amendment Act 1998.

The Myall Creek massacre is one of the first instances of change in dynamic, and respect towards Indigenous Australians. In 1838, after some Gamilaraay people had relocated, 11 British settlers (many of them convicts) brutally and horrifically slaughtered the Gamilaraay people (many of them women and children) at Myall Creek station. What makes this case considerably different than other cases of massacres on Aboriginal Australians is that it was the first time they were recognised as people with some basis of rights. After an initial not guilty ruling, a second trial saw the men found guilty, with 7 of the 11 hanged for their crimes. Chief Justice James Downing stated a newfound ideal that a small few now held, stating 'the life of a black is just as precious in the eyes of the law as the highest noble in the land'. Although many still held a racist superiority, with the Sydney Morning Herald describing Indigenous Australians as a 'gang of black animals', this judicial decision marked the first instance of an identifiable switch, paving the way for broader Indigenous acceptance and power granted. This example depicts how when Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are acknowledged through the law it inspires future reform, for instance when during the first world war some Indigenous men were able to serve. Each piece of legislation clearly brought closer a higher power and authority.",19

The legislation which abolished terra nullius, a term which had previously limited the power of Indigenous Australians as Pratt et al outline 'The concept that they had no inherent right over the land they had been nurturing for thousands of years'. With this legislation, they gained an outlet to demand their land back, therefore providing an immense amount of authority never previously acknowledged. It would not be for the judicial finding of the 1992 Mabo decision and 1993 Native Title Act that Indigenous Australians would have a genuine authority. As Paul Keating outlined in his 1992 Redfern, Sydney, speech 'recognition that it was us who did the dispossessing ... we brought the diseases, the alcohol', it's only through this legislation that the power to demand accountability, and secure the land they had been fighting for for years could occur.

Indigenous resistance and decisions in both time periods also had a substantial effect. When settlers invaded their homeland, Indigenous Australians utilised both violent and economic means to resist, and therefore establishing a power over settlers. Henry Reynolds describes this violence as with 'brutality and great loss of life' concluding that 'indigenous tribes did not acquiesce in the invasion of their homelands'. By acting in this violent way ensured that they were feared and held some extent of authority over white settlers. Similarly, as Richard Broome outlines they 'raided pastoral stations ... and farms', allowing them to cause numerous issues for settlers when establishing a life. Taking settlers resources also gave them some amounts of power, due to their superior bushcraft and knowledge of the land they could also further be undetectable.",21

Their signs read 'land rights or blood shed', standing as a symbol of defiance. This defiance would influence and continue to influence undeniable change. The Embassy attracted an immense amount of attention from the media with opposition leader Gough Whitlam visiting the site. The Embassy can be credited for influencing Whitlam's later reforms when elected in December of 1972 where he would increase the power of Indigenous Australians, for instance abolishing assimilation and creating the Consultative Committee for Aboriginal Affairs.

From the end of the first world war in 1918, Australians felt an emerging sense of 'national identity [associated] with service (Bongiorno). This was reflected in the countless homecoming parades held on the homefront, as Australians were 'anxious to show their praise and pride for the Anzacs' (Ham). Thus, this reflected in the celebration of Anzac Day by all states by 1921, which echoed the returning servicemen being 'labelled as heroes' (Hughes), as this commemoration was made a national day in 1927 - known as Anzac Day. This positive experience was prominent throughout 1939-1945, as soldiers were celebrated upon homecoming for their contributions to not only the war but to national identity. This was underscored by the commemoration of WWII soldiers within Anzac Day. Despite this, soldiers who returned home from the Vietnam War in 1973 were not met with this positivity. Although there was evidence of warm homecomings, Vietnam veterans described their experience as 'leave a war to return to another' (Ham). This was mirrored in homecoming parades, as a Vietnam veteran recalls 'we were pelted with tomatoes and spat on'. This ultimately left veterans 'isolated from their communities' (Ham) and society. The attempts to remedy this discontent was prominent through the 1987 Welcome Home Parade, which saw over 200 media outlets stream the marching of Australian soldiers from Vietnam. This commemorate enabled veterans to 'face Vietnam' which thus enabled a remedy to the negative homecoming experience. Thus, there is a continuity of soldiers experiencing positive homecomings.",28

The return of soldiers in WW1 were 'arguably offered more than any other countries' (Mirams) as soldiers were remedied through social contracts. This was prominent in the introduction of the soldier settlement scheme, which provided 40 000 soldiers with farms to live on post the war. This positive government response was echoed in World War II, as soldiers returned to a post war life that aimed to be 'equitable, prosperous and stable' (Ham). As such was established through the development of the Australian National University (1941), which provided a postgraduate institution for soldiers to attain an education. These two responses underscore the positive attempts to commemorate the work of soldiers. However, as such was not evident for returning soldiers from the Vietnam War, as ultimately there was limited support. The government's denial of the impact of Agent Orange in Vietnam underscored the negative experiences for veterans. This ultimately left veterans isolated, as the RSL denied commemoration and support to soldiers. As a result, this left Vietnam veterans with negative experiences that required the establishment of industrial organisations such as the Vietnam Veterans Association in the 1980s.
