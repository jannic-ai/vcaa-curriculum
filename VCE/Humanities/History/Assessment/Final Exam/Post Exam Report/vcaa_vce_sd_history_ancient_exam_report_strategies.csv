Funerary customs are such as the opening of the mouth ceremony and the use of spells in the Book of the Dead were common funerary practices Egyptian afterlife and would occur before the deceased individual was then judged against a feather truth by Osiris. The Egyptian vision of the afterlife is reflected in the greenery and the inundated Nile at the top of Source 2 where Nakht enjoys fishing and hunting birds, common pastimes of the nobility. He and his wife also receive offerings of fruit, fish and birds to sustain them in the afterlife. However, these practices changed during the Amana period (1353 to 1336).

His palace of Malkata completed in year 29 was more colossal and extravagant than any other building of his era - it was 32 hectares in size with gardens, orchards, courtyards, housing and temples. The palace expressed his wealth as king and thus the wealth and power of the state.

Firstly his contributions to the temples at Karnak, including the Gempaaten, and the construction of open-air to temples represented a shift of religious beliefs that disrupted the political and social traditions of Egypt by elevating the Aten. By year 5 of Akhenaten's reign he had completely uprooted and transferred the capital of Egypt 400 km from Thebes to his new city, Akhetaten, using smaller talatat blocks to accelerate the building process. The creation of Akhetaten furthered his political aims of shifting Egyptian religion and royal administration to be built around the Aten. Inscriptions and carvings at Akhetaten show the royal family touched by the rays of the sun and the open-air structures further emphasised the dominance of the solar disc. The shift to Atenism involved 'persecution...directed at Amun' (Hornung), undermining the strength of that priesthood in favour of his new deity since worship of the Aten and of Amun 'could no longer be carried out side by side' (Alder).",103

A few students mentioned the revolts on Naxos and Thasos (469 and 465 BCE respectively); these were, properly speaking, before the timeframe specified in the question, but could be useful to provide context. The destruction of Melos (416 BCE) was also mentioned in a few responses; while this event might demonstrate the nature of the Athenian democracy at this time, Melos was not a member of the Delian League.",,193
Humanities,History,VCEHAN,Ancient History,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEHANERA,VCEHAN24EQA2,VCEHANERAER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 2e,StudentResponse,The following is an example of a high-scoring response:,"After 460 BCE, it was largely not beneficial for a Greek city state to be a member of the Delian League. The original purpose of the league was to act as a defence alliance against Persia with the smaller Aegean states providing ships or money to Athens in return for military protection. However, by 460 BCE Athens had largely defeated the Persians and this transformed the Delian League from a league that benefitted at all to one that only benefitted Athens by and after 460 BCE. Despite the absence of a credible Persian threat after 449 with the Peace of Callias, Athens continued to collect tribute from the allies and used it for the beautification of their polis with them claiming that they were 'not obliged' to justify how 'they spent the allies' money' (Thucydides). Rather than paying to ensure their safety against Persia the members of the Delian League were now paying for Athens to repair the Parthenon, especially after the Delian treasury was moved to Athens in 454 BCE. While it was clearly no longer beneficial for a Greek city state to be a member of the Delian League after 460 BCE due to the absence Persian threat, it was worse for a polis to revolt against Athens or refused to subject themselves to Athens' control. Those city states which attempted to leave the League face brutal punishments. For example, after the city of Scione in northern Greece defected to the Spartans in 423 BCE, the Athenians recaptured it and killed the entire adult population and made slaves of the women and children. The Athenians were equally brutal to those that attempted to resist subjugation, such as at Melos. Melos refused to be subjected to Athenian rule in 416 BCE and Athens once more killed the entire male population, sold the women and children into slavery and established a cleruchy (military colony) on the island. Those not punished so drastically by Athens still faced humiliation, for example, after the revolt of Euboea in 446 BC not only did Athens expel the Chalcidian elite and establish a garrison there but also made all Chalcidian men of fighting age swear a humiliating oath of eternal loyalty to Athens (known as the Chalcis Decree). Therefore this makes it clear that while there was no longer any benefits for the city states in the Delian League after 460 BCE it was safer for them to remain in the Delian League than to suffer the 'evils' that the Athenians would commit against subject states that revolted (Buckley).",194

Following the expulsion of the last king, Tarquinius Superbus, after his son Sextus raped Lucretia, kings were 'an object of hatred' (Beard). Rome therefore established a system that would distribute power amongst the people in magistracies and assemblies in addition to the senate. The 'executive authority' was conferred by the Comitia Curiata on the consuls elected by the Centuriate Assembly but the power granted to consuls or dictators was of limited duration and most magistrates had to share their role. The patrician Senate controlled the treasury and affairs of the state such as building programs. The plebeians were also able to gain power following the revolution in 509 starting in 494 with the First Seccession, refusing to fight in the military until their grievances were. Further political change flowed from the revolution, with the introduction of laws in the Twelve Tables (449), the Licinian-Sextian laws (367) allowing plebeians to run for consul, the Lex Genucia (342) making a plebeian consul compulsory and eventually the Hortensian Laws (287) allowing laws made in the Plebeian Council applicable to all. Thus the revolution in 509 caused political change in Rome by ending the monarch and distributing power among the people in a complex set of class distinction, magistracies and assemblies.",223

They were unable to vote, participate in assemblies or hold civic or military positions. The main role was to provide legitimate heirs for their husband and their activities tended to be within the household, such as preparing meals and spinning wool for cloths. Nevertheless, women in ancient Rome had 'much greater independence' than most women at the time (Beard) and were capable of participating in a variety of social activities. For example, as seen in source nine the presence of women in the religious procession alongside men demonstrates that they were able to take part in religious activities of the state. The Vestal Virgins, in particular, held very important roles as the high priestesses of the state temple of Rome. Moreover, women could also attend shows at the theatre and eat at dinner parties alongside men. They also had some degree of economic independence as they could buy and sell property in their own right, make a will and free slaves.",241

Realising that his position was hopeless, Antony feigned an attack on Agrippa's fleet, allowing himself, Cleopatra and the Egyptian treasury to escape while leaving the rest of his forces trapped in the bay. Not only did Antony lose most of his fleet but his cowardly abandonment of his men ensured that his force would defect to Octavian and bolstered Octavian's power. This, and the defection of Antony's other troops in Libya, ensured that he could no longer defeat Octavian in the Battle of Alexandria in 30 BCE. Thus the Battle of Actium was the most significant event in the rivalry between Octavian and Antony because it led to Octavian cementing his status is the most powerful man in Rome.",268

Octavian was also able to prosecute war more easily against Antony in 31 BCE by presenting it as a fought against a foreign power led by a woman who was 'dangerous, regal and seductive' (Beard).

Because of Nefertiti's great prestige some scholars even speculate on her role as co-regent and thus she would have played a major role in the crisis of the Amarna period. These changes to tradition contributed to instability during Akhenaten's rule, presenting him as a weaker pharaoh by getting the queen to carry out the king's tasks. Talatats at Amarna confirm Nefertiti's ability to 'abandon the traditional role of the queen as passive observer' (Stevenson), with talatats depicting Nefertiti smiting her enemies and holding them by the hair in the manner of a pharaoh. By being presented in the manner of a pharaoh and Akhenaten's absence from military activity, the king's reputation was undermined, creating uncertainty in the people and adding to the crisis of the Amarna period.",33

Amenhotep III paved the way for Akhenaten, building a temple to the Aten, creating the House of the Dazzling Sun Disc and shifting the focus from the previous state god Amun. Amenhotep III's intimidation of the cult of Amun was clear with him in his extensive building program and by moving funding and tribute away from cult of Amun. Their power was further weakened by disbanding the priesthoods of Amun and shutting the temples, establishing the conditions for the crisis. The deification of Amenhotep showed Akhenaten that he could achieve ascendancy by presenting himself in a divine triad (along with Nefertiti and the Aten) replacing Nut, Khonsu and Amun. Thus, Amenhotep III created precedents that Akhenaten followed.",34

Through his close relationship with the Aten, Akhenaten was worshipped as a god (or at least closely associated with the monotheistic religion) but this came at a cost, causing crisis in Egypt. In the Southern Tomb Cemetery in Akhetaten excavations show that 65% of the population suffered from an accumulation of stress fractures from carrying heavy loads, early deaths and malnourishment. Alongside this neglect and possible famine of the population is evidence showing that much food went to the Aten as offerings. Life in Amana was 'not the paradise in the desert that Akhenaten wanted everyone so much to believe it to be' (Kemp). Furthermore, the crisis of the period is demonstrated by Akhenaten's withdrawal from foreign affairs shown in the Amarna letters which state that 'Hittite troops have set the country on fire but my Lord has done nothing to them', suggesting Akhenaten did not intervene in the military conflict of his allies even when requested to and in the Boundary Stele he declares 'I will not go outside these walls'. This isolation may have undermined the scope of Egypt's influence in international matters.",35

Alcibiades' actions contributed to creating circumstances that led to the Spartan victory. However, the actions of Lysander in this war also enabled Sparta to gain victory over Athens while the Athenian Assembly itself created worse conditions for Athens.",55

At Sparta, Alcibiades persuaded the Gerousia and Assembly to send aid to Syracuse in 413 BCE. This led to the Syracusans' victory over the Athenian forces. This loss scores great strain on the Athenian treasury as they had heavily invested in the expedition, believing they would gain victory. Thucydides notes that the fleet Athens sent to Sicily was 'the finest and most costly Hellenic troops'. Alcibiades also persuaded Sparta to fortify Decelea in 413 BCE. This enabled the Spartans to cut off the Athenian land route to Euboea (of source of grain and cattle) thus causing Athens to rely on its sea routes to get its supplies. Decelea was also close to the silver mines at Larium which enabled Athenian slaves working there to escape and find refuge. Around 20,000 slaves escaped within a year. With less silver being mined, Athens lost a crucial source of its income, thus further increasing the economic strain on Athens. Furthermore, thanks to Alcibiades' advice, Sparta could use Decelea as a base to do more frequent raids into Attica. This caused Athens to have to focus some of its troops in protecting Athens by land. Alcibiades also further weakened Athenian politics in 411 by supporting the oligarch revolt at Athens, temporarily but significantly destabilising Athens, thus helping Sparta to a victorious outcome in the Decelean War.",56

Lysander moved the Peloponnesian naval base from Miletus to Ephesus, allowing them to bypass the Athenian fleet at Samos and move about the Aegean more freely. Lysander also studied the tactics of the battle of Cyzicus in 410 BC and then he trained his sailors accordingly which better enabled them to face the experience Athenian navy. Lysander also gained an alliance with the Persian satrap, Cyrus the Younger, who provided Sparta with funding. This enabled them to increase sailors' pay from three to four obols per day. As Plutarch noted, this action enabled the Spartans to 'empty out the Athenian ships' and gain experienced sailors. Through this action, Lysander was able to be 'innovative and strategic' (Bradley) and gain victories at Notium (406 BCE) and Aegospotami (405 BCE). After the victory at Aegospotami, then Spartans were able to besiege Athens by sea while the Sparta king Agis attacked by land. This forced the Athenians to surrender in 401 BCE, bringing the Decelean War to an end.",57

Bradley notes these 'internal struggles' ultimately caused Athens to lose the war. Arginusae (406 BCE) were victorious against Sparta after their loss at Notium. However, the night of the victory, the generals decided not to rescue their fellow sailors due to storm. The angry Athenian assembly decided to execute six of the eight generals of this battle. This decision weakened the power of the Athenian navy and prompted the new generals to be cautious in their decisions. This loss of experience caused Athens to lose the decisive battle of Aegospotami in 405 BCE and made the outcome of the Decelean War a more likely victory for Sparta.",58

He used this method again in 82, marching on Rome and forcing the Senate to make him dictator, acquiring power by force rather than rising through the traditional cursus honorum and thereby undermining traditional Republican ideals. Sulla further proved that the state was no longer governed by the law but 'by the sword' (Cicero) by introducing proscriptions in 82 as a means of eliminating his rivals.

These contraventions were the first steps in the 'collapse of the republic' (Cassius Dio) which continued to be broken down by Gaius Marius who held the position of consul seven times throughout his life starting in 107.

Furthermore, this example of violence continued to influence the leaders after Sulla's retirement in 80, demonstrated by the Second Triumvirate's (43 to 33) re-introduction of proscription, mirroring Sulla's method of eliminating rivals.

While the Senate managed finances and foreign policy, and consuls held executive power, the people retained sovereignty through their ability to confer honour and enforce justice. It acknowledges the people as the ultimate arbiters of political and moral legitimacy, balancing the aristocratic and monarchical elements of the system.",,251
Humanities,History,VCEHAN,Ancient History,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEHANERA,VCEHAN25EQA3,VCEHANERAER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 3c,StudentResponse,The following is an example of a high-scoring student response:,"First, much power was concentrated in the oligarchic institution of the Roman Senate, particularly in the early Republic, and had a significant role in overseeing foreign policy, finances and proposing legislation. Indeed, according to Source 11, the Senate ""has these various functions, especially the control of receipts and expenditure of the exchequer"", thus having a monopoly of power over the other Republican institutions such as the assemblies of the Comitia Centuriata and Concilium Plebis, the latter added in 471 BC. According to Gwynne, ""true political power lay in the early Republic did not lie with the individual magistrates, but with the collective authority of the Senate"", thus limiting the ability for the broad mass of Romans to have an effective role in government. Second, the leading office of consul, of which there was two, was proven to have limitations in effectively conducting war, due to their annual re-election. This was most evident in the campaign against Hannibal during the Second Punic War of 218-201 BC, in which the constantly changing military command of the consuls undermined the ability of Rome to initially achieve victory, especially in the disastrous defeat at Cannae in 216 BCE, despite their ""absolute authority in the field"" (source 11). Thus, the political institutions of the Senate and consuls not only concentrated power unequally with the wealthy, but proved inefficient in effectively conducting war.",252

Pompey's imperium over 270 ships and 125,000 men in 67 to clear out pirates represented a departure from Roman values and ideals of power being shared, a precedent set by Pompey that would impact Republican politics until its demise. Indeed, Pompey ""seems to have responded well to devotion, be it from an army or a wife"" (Goldworthy); as such, the general's popularity influenced his meteoric rise to power in a system ossified by archaic tradition. Moreover, ""in the East, Pompey was little short of a monarch"" (Scullard), owing to his giddying heights of gloria and dignitas attained from ""his victory over Hiarbas"" (S12) in a previous engagement in Africa. Thus, Pompey's early military successes set the precedent for the rise of over-powerful military commanders able to ""throw their hat in the political ring"" (Hamble), causing great concern among staunch Republicans like Cato the Younger.",292

Humanities,History,VCEHAN,Ancient History,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEHANERB,VCEHAN25EQB1,VCEHANERBER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 1,StudentResponse,The following is an example of a high-scoring student response:,"Although the Amarna period marked a crisis in New Kingdom Egypt, Akhenaten fulfilled the position of god-king to a large extent. In conventional Egyptian values, the god-king affirmed his divine right to rule through a close connection with the gods. Akhenaten's pursuit of monotheism achieved this through his building campaigns and reforms to festivals. Through this he affirmed his right to rule under the Aten. However, Akhenaten's inability to maintain ma'at or divine order demonstrates his failure in the position of god-king. Hence, he achieved his role to a large extent.",31
Humanities,History,VCEHAN,Ancient History,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEHANERB,VCEHAN25EQB1,VCEHANERBER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 1,StudentResponse,,"Akhenaten's employment of building campaigns throughout his reign reflected the traditional pursuit of achieving the role of the god-king. Primarily, this is reflected in the boundary stela at Akhetaten that emphasise [Akhenaten's] close relationship with the Aten as he reflects on ""Aten, my father"". The emphasis of the divine connection between Akhenaten and the sun god is similar to other kings and their pursuit of the role of god-king. Such as Hatshepsut claiming Amun to be her father at her mortuary temple at Dier El Bahri. Wherein her coronation scene reflects Amun's wish that ""my soul is hers; my bounty is hers; my crown shall be hers"". Therefore, the similarities between Akhenaten and Hatshepsut's use of building campaigns suggest his achievement of the position of the god-king. In addition, this is further emphasised through reliefs at Akhetaten such as in Gem-pa-Aten of Akhenaten, Nefertiti, and the Aten. The depiction of the king and queen as completing the triad with the Aten suggested their ""divine connection and equality"" (Tyldesley) with the god. Further, this was also suggested through the limitation of worship to only Nefertiti and Akhenaten being permitted to worship the Aten. Hence, the building campaigns of Akhenaten exhibited his achievement of the role of god-king through his exclusive and divine connection to the Aten.",32
Humanities,History,VCEHAN,Ancient History,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEHANERB,VCEHAN25EQB1,VCEHANERBER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 1,StudentResponse,,"The reforms to religious festivals implemented by Akhenaten further emphasised his divine connection to the Aten and achievement of the role of god-king. His abolition of traditional festivals such as the Beautiful Feast of the Valley ""had a profoundly alienating effect on the populous"" (Wilkinson) yet elevated his own position in leadership. This is exhibited in the implementation of the Processional Way, wherein Akhenaten and Nefertiti would process through Akhetaten and be worshipped by citizens. Hence, Akhenaten emphasised his own position to equal that of the gods of the festivals whom he had abolished. This is further exhibited through the decree that ""no mention of the Amun, his cult, or his temple"" (Boundary Stela K) would be tolerated in Akhetaten. Through this, Akhenaten aimed to elevate the Aten and consequently himself to a higher level of respect than the plethora of traditional gods, such as Khonsu or Mut. His use of ceremonies to suggest this is also highlighted by the Window of Appearance wherein himself and Nefertiti would accept offerings and worship on behalf of the Aten. Hence, he demonstrated his achievement of ""elevating the exclusivity of religion in Egypt"" (Wilson) in order to achieve a higher position that rivalled the cult of Amun. Ultimately, he employed the use of ceremonies and festivals in order to suggest his achievement of divine connection.",33
Humanities,History,VCEHAN,Ancient History,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEHANERB,VCEHAN25EQB1,VCEHANERBER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 1,StudentResponse,,"However, the inability of Akhenaten to achieve ma'at through his withdrawal from governance suggests his inability to completely fulfil the role of the god-king. This is primarily emphasised through his lack of engagement with foreign policy as reflected in the Amarna letters. Such as from the king of Byblos who urged Akhenaten to ""send archers, lest all be lost!"" The Amarna Letters reflected the ignorance of Akhenaten towards vassal and brother states due to his own preoccupation with religious reforms. Through the detriment and conflict that was experienced in these states it is evident that ma'at was not achieved. In addition, the prevalence of illness and starvation in Akhetaten further emphasised the inability of the heretic king to provide order to his people. As the North graveyard holds evidence of up to 6,000 of the city's residents to have experienced malnutrition. The stark contrast between the prosperity suggested by Akhenaten's building campaign and the illness of his people suggests his inability to achieve the role of god-king. This is further exhibited through the Restoration Period as Tutankhamun reflected that ""the gods have turned their backs on this land"" (Restoration Stela). Through this, he emphasised how Akhenaten and his unconventional rule disrupted the achievement of ma'at that should be assured by a god-king. Hence, the reign of Akhenaten did not allow him to fully achieve this position as he did not achieve divine order.",34

Although the outbreak of the Archidamian War can be attributed to Sparta's fear of Athens, the role of Athens or the cultural acception of war were also significant contributions to the outbreak of conflict.",66
Humanities,History,VCEHAN,Ancient History,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEHANERB,VCEHAN25EQB2,VCEHANERBER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 2,StudentResponse,,"Sparta's role in causing the outbreak of the Archidamian War can be attributed to its fear of the growth of Athenian power. Although King Archidamus was a xenos, a guest friend of Pericles, as their grandfathers had served together in the Persian Wars, the invasion of Attica in 431 BCE, led Archidamus of Sparta displayed how personal diplomacy was overcome by political rivalry. This political rivalry can be attributed to the growth of Athenian supremacy in the Aegean, and the fear this invoked in Sparta. Thucydides claims how the rapid acceleration of Athenian growth ""inspired fear in Lacademon [and this] ... made war inevitable"". Historian Kallet-Marx upholds this claim, asserting how ""Athenian democracy ... incited fear into the hearts of Greek oligarchs, Sparta and elsewhere."" Sparta harboured an intense fear of the radical nature of Athenian democracy, which threatened its rigid oligarchic structure. The centralised individualism of Athens threatened the collectivism of Spartan society, and this was exemplified through the Spartan refusal of Athenian aid following the Spartan earthquake of 464 BCE, out of fear of Athenian envoys spreading democratic ideals among Spartans. This intense fear from Sparta culminated in the outbreak of conflict, as Powell contends how the Spartans were kept ""chronically ready for war"" by Athenian expansion. Sparta's fear of the immense growth of Athenian power is also exemplified by Thucydides observation of the Athenian war chest by 431 BCE, consisting of the annual tributes of the allies of 600 talents, 1600 unmounted bowmen and 300 triremes. Evidently, the growth of power in Athens, and the fear that Sparta held as a result, contributed to the outbreak of the Archidamian War.",67
Humanities,History,VCEHAN,Ancient History,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEHANERB,VCEHAN25EQB2,VCEHANERBER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 2,StudentResponse,,"However, the outbreak of the Archidamian War can also be attributed to the role of Athens. Sparta was highly reluctant to declare war on Athens, yet were pressured to do so due to the actions of Athens 'inciting fear' into Corinth, and Corinth subsequently threating to leave the Peloponnesian League if Sparta failed to declare war on Athens. Under Pericles leadership, who was a dedicated imperialist, Athens exerted power and control over its allies. Notably, Athens broke the terms of the 30 years peace treaty with Sparta through assisting Corcyra in opposing a naval attack from Corinth at the Battle of Sybota in 433 BCE. D. Siculus conveys the impact of Athens presence at the Battle of Sybota, contending how this ""[constituted] a breach of their treaty with the Peloponnese"", which Athens was knowledgable of. Moreover, Athens instigated the outbreak of the Archidamian War through sending a list of unreasonable demands to Delian League member Potidaea in 432 BCE, pre-empting Potidaea succeding from the Athenian Empire. Moreover, Athens instigation of the outbreak of the Archidamian War was furthered by the implementation of the Megarian Decree of 432 BCE. This was an ""extreme demonstration of Athenian imperialism"" (Meiggs), and directly provoked Sparta to demand the Athenians to rescind the decree and take down the Athenian long walls, or face the outbreak of war. Ultimately, the role of Athens in the outbreak of the Archidamian War was a great significance.",68
Humanities,History,VCEHAN,Ancient History,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEHANERB,VCEHAN25EQB2,VCEHANERBER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 2,StudentResponse,,"Yet, another contributing factor to the outbreak of the Archidamian War was the cultural acception of conflict in Ancient Greece. Both Athens and Sparta viewed concessions as a sign of weakness, as exemplified by Pericles belief to ""never decline the dangers of war"" (Thucydides). Battle in Ancient Greece was highly stigmatized, being seen as the ""clearest expression of manly excellence"" (Tritle). J.E Lendon reinforces Tritle's view, claiming how Thucydides failed to consider the ""culture of Greek foreign relations"" in the outbreak of war. Athens and Sparta, along with most city-states in Ancient Greece viewed foreign policy as a competitive ranking of prestige, rooted in the competitive culture of Ancient Greece. This competitive culture normalised the outbreak of battles and skirmishes as a means to achieve power and glory, thus justifying the outbreak of the Archidamian War to Athens and Sparta.",69

Events such as the amassing of power by Marius, the unlawful dictatorship of his contemporary, Sulla, and the trend continued by Caesar, symbolised the breakdown of classic, Cato-style Republican morality, foregone in the pursuit of power. Indeed, conflict and brutality utilised by Caesar in his Gallic Wars in order to undermine the Republic demonstrates his own departure from Republican values, influencing the fall of the Republic. Yet Roman militarism, from the birth of the city to its transformation into the Empire, played an equally pivotal role in the fall of the Republic.",100

First, Gaius Marius' consulships from 104-100 and in 86 BC, represent his flagrant disregard for the office of the consuls, a departure from Roman ideals of checks on power and a limit on term lengths. Similarly, Pompey's assumption of sole consulship in 52 BC represents a radical subversion of Republican morality, as it was ""an office, which, by definition, had always been shared by two"" (Beard). Thus, the erosion of Roman morality and values manifest in the unprecedented careers of Marius and Pompey allowed them to amass the gloria and power required to effectively [dismantle] the Republic and hasten its demise, in 23 BC under the Second Settlement of Augustus. Further, Sulla's dictatorships in 88 and 80 during a Civil War that claimed 200,000 lives emblematises the erosion of Republican morality that had begun to dominate the Republic, further evidenced by his proscriptions that killed 2,600 people in Rome, many of them senators. Such an exercise of arbitrary despotism, a critical rejection of the ideals promulgated by Cato the Elder, thus hastened the demise of the Res Publica. Thus, through the amassing of power and exercise of despotism, the Republic's downfall was set in motion, setting the precedents for its actual demise.",101
Humanities,History,VCEHAN,Ancient History,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEHANERB,VCEHAN25EQB3,VCEHANERBER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 3,StudentResponse,,"Further, Julius Caesar's political and military career typified the erosion of Republican ideals, through his rebarbative conquest of Gaul and disregard for Roman policy. Caesar's Gallic Wars from 58-50 BCE saw 500,000 Gauls enslaved, 1,000,000 slaughtered, and the corruption of Caesar himself; ""in Gaul, Caesar acquired the taste and resources for monarchy"" (Lintott), a radical endorsement of the abhorred title of rex that Caesar internalised, corrupting the ideals of the Republic even as he conquered in its name. The battle of the Sambre in 57 BC, seeing 30,000 Romans defeat 80,000 Nervii in ""the hardest-fought of Caesar's battles"" (Goldsworthy) and the subjugation of the Atuatuci in 56, seeing 53,000 tribespeople killed and 4,000 enslaved by Caesar, caused Pliny to describe his conquests as a ""crime against humanity"",  and as such, representative of the increasing demise of Republican values that would lead Caesar to proclaim ""the Republic is nothing, a mere name without form or substance"", an admission of his disregard for the Republican ideals that had lent Rome her greatness. Further on, Caesar's ""conquests in Gaul were intended to be spectacular, for he had ever an eye on opinion back in Rome"" (Goldsworthy) and was eager to further his political career thanks to his identity as a ""man intent on flouting the traditions of the Republic"" (Gwynn). As such, Caesar's command over his legions due to the booty acquired in Gaul - Caesar enjoyed a personal income of 400,000 gold pieces annually -meant that ""the dictatorship, when combined with overwhelming military force, was the means by which autocracy was expressed"" (Steel) - an autocracy that held contempt for the ideals and morality of the Republic. Ultimately, Caesar's career, and the barbarity of his Gallic Wars, eroded Republican ideals, and contributed to the demise of the Res Publica.",102

By 100 BC, almost 66% of any Roman army ""invariably consisted of allied soldiers"" (Gwynn), meaning that when the Social War broke out from 91-87 BC, Rome was confronted with its oppressive nature and subjugating tendencies, which originated out of its militarism and combat-centred philosophies. As such, Rome's militarism and conflict with its allies had long existed, especially at the Battle of Lake Regillus in 496, where 24,700 Romans defeated 50,000 Latins, and the Siege of Veii from 405-316, where ""defeat for either would mean extinction"" (Livy). Through the constant tension between Rome and her allies, the Republic found itself a ""victim of its own success"" (Gwynn), as in its militarism and desire for conquest, it had enabled the suppression and the deprivation of rights to flourish amongst its allied soldiers. Moreover, militarism in the late Republic, manifest in the Civil Wars of the 80s, 49-45 and 32-30, effectively brought about the Republic's demise, especially At Actium, where Octavian and Agrippa's 400 ships defeated 270 of Antony's, killing 5000 men.
