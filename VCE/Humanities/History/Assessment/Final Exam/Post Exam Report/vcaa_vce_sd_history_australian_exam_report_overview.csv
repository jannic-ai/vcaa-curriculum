Humanities,History,VCEHAU,Australian History,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEHAUER,VCEHAUERGC,General Comments,,"The 2024 VCE Australian History examination consisted of two sections, with questions based on each of the four investigations in the VCE History Study Design 2022-2026: Australian History. Students were required to respond to two out of four questions in Section A and select one out of four essay questions in Section B.",,0

Humanities,History,VCEHAU,Australian History,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEHAUER,VCEHAUERGC,General Comments,,"Higher-scoring responses were often distinguished by their use of accurate and specific knowledge, including dates or places to establish context, or references to specific individuals, groups or artefacts from the period to establish different perspectives (e.g., Vida Goldstein, Daniel Mannix, union representatives, Women's Suffrage groups or specific propaganda such as the Blood Vote anti-conscription poster).",,2
Humanities,History,VCEHAU,Australian History,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEHAUER,VCEHAUERGC,General Comments,,"Higher-scoring responses often used quotes from the period or from historians to add to the sources provided for short-answer source analysis questions. Using evidence from the period or from historians was required for the eight-mark responses and for high-scoring essay responses in Section B. Paraphrasing arguments or perspectives is an acceptable form of using evidence. However, placing a historian's name in brackets following a common phrase, such as 'working man's paradise', is not considered a useful form of evidence, and students need to ensure that they only reference a historian in relation to that historian's area of expertise. For example, Richard Broome was often cited in answers about war and upheaval, despite his area of specialisation lying elsewhere.",,3
Humanities,History,VCEHAU,Australian History,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEHAUER,VCEHAUERGC,General Comments,,"Particularly for extended responses and the essay, higher-scoring responses provided a sense of nuance in their argument, or exceptions to the dominant line of argument.",,4
Humanities,History,VCEHAU,Australian History,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEHAUER,VCEHAUERGC,General Comments,,"Students should carefully read and interpret the wording of questions. For example, many students focused on immigration broadly when responding to Question 2e., rather than on the concept of immigrants that appeared in the question. Furthermore, essay Question 1 asked about where European colonisation caused more change to the Australian landscape than to Aboriginal custodianship and culture, but some students instead compared the impacts of the two different approaches to land use and management.",,5
Humanities,History,VCEHAU,Australian History,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEHAUER,VCEHAUERGC,General Comments,,"A minority of students attempted to answer more than two questions in Section A and this diminished the depth and quality of their answers. It also often meant that the student was unable to attempt, or fully construct, an essay response for Section B. Some students spent too much time on and wrote too many words in Section A, often using extra space, but then wrote a comparatively less well-constructed essay in Section B. Students are reminded to distribute their time appropriately across both sections of the examination.",,6
Humanities,History,VCEHAU,Australian History,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEHAUER,VCEHAUERGC,General Comments,,"Handwriting also remains an area of concern. While every effort is made by assessors to read every word, there are instances when this is not possible. Illegible handwriting can upset the flow and coherence of an answer, and marks cannot be awarded for words or sentences that cannot be read.",,7
