This extract is a historical interpretation that describes the results of Thutmosis I I's military campaigns.
Thutmose' I I's military successes brought an influx of wealth into the Egyptian economy. Taxes
and tribute came from lands as far apart as Nubia, Retennu,? Babylon and Naharin,®and from the
Hit ites and the Keftiu (The Minoans). This allowed one of the most prolific building programs in
Egyptian history.
Thutmose's devotion to the gods of ancient Egypt, especially Amen? of Thebes, resulted in the
rebuilding and embellishment® of many of the key religious sites in Egypt at that time. Forts were
constructed, canals reopened and naval ports expanded. For over 50 years Thutmose dominated
Egypt and the Near East and was respected by the Egyptians so much that 500 years later
Pinudjem | of the 21st Dynasty named his son after him.

This is an extract from an inscription that was carved on a stela at Abydos. It describes how Ahmose I,
the founder of the Eighteenth Dynasty, honoured his grandmother, Tetisheri.
Now, it came to pass that his majesty sat in the audience-hall . . the King of Upper and Lower
Egypt, Nebpehtire, Son of Re, Ahmose (1), given life; while the hereditary princess, great in favor,
great in amiability, king''s-daughter, king's-sister, divine consort, great king's-wife, Ahmose-
Nefretiri, who liveth,2 was with his majesty.
The king himself spake? to her: ""I, it is, who have remembered the mother of my mother, and the
mother of my father, great king's-wife and king's-mother, Tetisheri . . triumphant. (Although) she
already has a tomb . . and a mortuary chapel . . on the soil of Thebes and Abydos, | have said this
to thee,* in that my majesty has desired to have made for her (also) a pyramid and a house ..
Tazeser, as a monumental donation of my majesty. Its lake shall be dug, its trees shall be planted,
its offerings shall be founded, equipped with people, endowed with® lands, presented with herds,
mortuary priests and ritual priests having their duties, every man knowing his stipulation.""®
.. His majesty did this because he so greatly loved her, beyond everything.

This extract is a historical interpretation that describes the key features of tyranny in Ancient Greece.
.. from the mid seventh century a series of usurpers began to seize autocratic power in the more
advanced cities, establishing dynasties which usually lasted for some two generations before they
were overthrown and replaced by hoplite'-dominated governments . . Thus for a century or more
after about 650, tyranny was one of the prevalent forms of government in the Greek cities . . During
this period it was also the tyrants who dominated the political and artistic life of the Greek world, and
who captured the popular imagination in tradition. The experience of tyranny created a fascination
and a hatred which permanently influenced Greek political attitudes against monarchy .
.. tyranny is defined as absolute rule exercised contrary to customary law,2 or at the whim? of the
ruler; and it is contrasted with kingship, which is absolute rule in accordance with customary law,
or for the benefit of the subjects. Itis regarded . as the worst possible form of government, worse
even than mob-rule, with which indeed it is held to have some connection.

This extract from Aristotle describes the personality of Cleon.
After the death of Pericles, Nicias, who later died in Sicily, became the leader of the aristocratic
party, and Cleon, the son of Cleaenetus, the leader of the people. This man, more than anybody
else, appears to have corrupted the people by his violent methods. He was the first who shouted on
the public platform, who used abusive language and who spoke with his cloak girt"" up about him,
while all the others used to speak in proper dress and manner.

This extract is a historical interpretation that describes the powers of the consuls in the
Roman Republic.
The consuls .. consult the senate on matters of urgency [and] carry out in detail the provisions of
its decrees. Again as concerns all affairs of state administered by the people it is their duty to take
these under their charge, to summon assemblies, to introduce measures, and to preside over the
execution of the popular decrees. As for preparation for war and the general conduct of operations
in the field, here their power is almost uncontrolled; for they are empowered to make what demands
they choose on the allies, to appoint military tribunes, to levy soldiers and select those who are
fittest for service. They also have the right of inflicting, when on active service, punishment on
anyone under their command; and they are authorized to spend any sum they decide upon from the
public funds, being accompanied by a quaestor! who faithfully executes their instructions.

1quaestor - a magistracy with financial and administrative duties
Source
This is a historical interpretation that outlines some of the political changes that occurred after the
Revolution of 509 BCE.
The establishment of the Roman Republic was due either to revolution or evolution; it was either
the effect or the cause of the fall of the monarchy . . the monarchy was abolished and two annual
magistrates named consuls . . were established in its place ..
.. With their subordinate officers they were responsible for the financial and general administration
of the state. This supreme executive authority, which was a basic constitutional conception,! was
conferred by the Comitia Curiata . . Later magistrates, e.g. censors and aediles, who took over
some of the consuls' duties, did not obtain imperium.?
In addition to the regular magistrates was the extraordinary office of dictator ..
Thus the Romans had provided an executive by creating a regular magistracy together with an
extraordinary emergency one. This executive was expected by custom to rely largely on the Council
of Elders and in practice it did . . Finally, of the two Assemblies of the People the Comitia Centuriata
gained increasing political influence and took over many of the functions of the Comitia Curiata ...

This is a historical interpretation, published in 2013, which describes the military campaigns of
Thutmosis III. Details of the campaigns were carved in the Temple of Karnak and dedicated to
Amun (Amen-Ra).
The most extensive presentation of the Karnak temple as receiver of income from military
campaigns abroad is found in the annals of Thutmose III1 ... in a concluding text it is stated
that all prisoners made on the king's first campaign (including over 1,500 ""Syrians"") were given
to Amun, in order to serve him as temple weavers and cultivators ... that cows from Egyptian,
Levantine and Nubian herds were donated to Amun for his milk offerings ... that three Canaanite
towns were assigned to Amun, and were charged with a yearly tax that contributed to the divine
offering ... The donations appear as a natural consequence of the king's victories, which are
explicitly said to have been made possible by his father Amun.

This is part of an inscription from the base of an obelisk erected by Hatshepsut in the Temple of Karnak.
It is the King himself1 who says:
I declare before the folk who shall be in the future,
Who shall observe the monument I made for my father2,
Who shall speak in discussion,
Who shall look to posterity3-
It was when I sat in the palace,
And thought of my maker,
That my heart led me to make for him
Two obelisks of electrum4,
Whose summits would reach the heavens,
In the august5 hall of columns,
Between the two great portals6 of the King,
The Strong Bull, King Aakheperkare7, the Horus triumphant.

This is an extract from the 'Earlier Proclamation', inscribed on the boundary stelae at Akhetaten in
Year 5 of Akhenaten's reign. It records the founding of Akhetaten by the king.
Then said his Person1 to them: ""Behold Aten! The Aten wishes to have [something] made for him
as a monument with an eternal and everlasting name. Now it is the Aten, my father, who advised
me concerning it, (namely) Akhet-Aten2. No official had ever advised me concerning it, nor had any
people in the entire land ever advised me concerning it, to tell me [a plan] for making Akhet-Aten
in this distant place ... It is the Aten, my [father], who advised me concerning it, (saying),
[fill] Akhet-Aten with provisions-a storehouse for everything!' while my father, HOR-ATEN3,
proclaimed to me, 'It is to belong to my Person, to be Akhet-Aten continually forever.'""

This is a historical interpretation, first published in 1935, which describes the status and conditions
placed on metics in Ancient Athens.
The importance of the resident aliens, the metics, varied greatly from state to state ... [In Athens]
they seem to have been most numerous and most highly favoured ... They were ... debarred1 from
the exercise of active political rights and from the possession of real property ... Yet they enjoyed
personal freedom ... [and] remained contented and often prosperous, and the Athenians had no
occasion ... to suspect them of disaffection or treachery.

This extract from the Athenian historian Thucydides recounts part of the speech of the Spartan king
Archidamus discussing preparations for war against Athens.
'Peloponnesians and allies, our fathers have engaged in many campaigns both in and outside
the Peloponnese, and the elder men in this army of ours are not inexperienced in war. Yet we
have never marched out in greater strength than now ... the whole of Hellas1 is eagerly watching
this action of ours, and, because of the general hatred against Athens, wishing us success in our
undertakings
The best and safest thing of all is when a large force is so well disciplined that it seems to be
acting like one man.'

This extract from the Greek historian and biographer Plutarch describes Lysander's actions leading up
to the end of the Decelean (Ionian) War.
Lysander sailed to the various cities in the neighbourhood and ordered all the Athenians he
found to return to Athens, and he proclaimed that anybody caught outside the city would be put
to death without exception. This step, which drove all the Athenians into the capital at once, was
deliberately taken so as to produce intense scarcity and famine in Athens as soon as possible,
and to forestall the necessity for a siege, against which the Athenians might otherwise have been
well provided.
... [Lysander] learned that the people of Athens were suffering terribly from famine, and so he
sailed into the Piraeus and reduced the city, which was forced to accept the terms he laid down.

This extract from the Roman historian Livy describes the rivalry between Romulus and Remus over the
foundation of Rome.
Remus is said to have been the first to receive an omen: six vultures appeared to him. The augury1
had just been announced to Romulus when double the number appeared to him. Each was saluted
as king by his own party. The one side based their claim on the priority of the appearance, the other
on the number of the birds. Then followed an angry altercation; heated passions led to bloodshed;
in the tumult2 Remus was killed. The more common report is that Remus contemptuously3 jumped
over the newly raised walls and was forthwith killed by the enraged Romulus, who exclaimed,
shall it be henceforth with every one who leaps over my walls."" Romulus thus became sole ruler,
and the city was called after him, its founder.

This extract from the Greek political historian Polybius describes the role of the people in the Roman
constitution.
[W]hat part is left for the people in the constitution, when the senate has these various functions,
especially the control of the receipts and expenditure of the exchequer1; and when the consuls,
again, have absolute power over the details of military preparation, and an absolute authority in
There is, however, a part left [to] the people, and it is a most important one. For the people
is the sole fountain of honor and of punishment; and it is by these two things and these alone that
dynasties and constitutions and, in a word, human society are held together

This is a historical interpretation, published in 1978, which examines Pompey's unconventional rise to
political prominence in Ancient Rome.
On 12 March 81 [BCE] ... Pompey held his triumph. It was officially for his victory over Hiarbas1,
since his other victories had been over Roman citizens
More important from the historical point of view is the effect his triumph must have had on the other
political leaders of the time. Centuries of tradition decreed that the aspiring politician should
slowly work his way up the ladder of promotion
And yet here was a young soldier ... winning a dangerous amount of personal popularity
with the people.
