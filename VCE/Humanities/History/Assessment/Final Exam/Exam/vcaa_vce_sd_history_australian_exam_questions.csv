Newspaper report on the establishment of the Royal National Park, published in 1879
Itis indeed somewhat strange that so large an area of Crown land', possessed of such natural
beauties, within fourteen miles of a populous city, should have remained so long unknown,
unvisited, and unappropriated2
.. Between the creek and the sea is a coast range of the usual sandstone formation . . The park
therefore will contain a great variety of grand and beautiful features .. it has the sandstone slopes,
with their peculiar forms and vegetation, with which the travellers on the Blue Mountains are now
familiar. It has in the valleys one attraction, no longer to be found in the well-known gulleys® of the
Blue Mountains, namely, splendid specimens of Australian timber.

Ahistorian's interpretation of how settlers justified moving into Aboriginal land
Anormal justification for settlers in moving onto Aboriginal lands was a reference to the Bible, and
in particular to God's Old Testament instruction to go forth and multiply and subdue' the earth,
quoted by the Herald? in the wake of the Myall Creek trials®, The Aborigines had failed to subdue
the earth and thus left it open to those who were willing to. Christopher Hodgson, a parson's4 son
who had farmed the Darling Downs west of Brisbane, wrote of his years in Australia, 'Thus far the
creator of the universe is just, in that He allows the superiority of civilisation over barbarism®,
intellect over instinct or brutish® reason . . the world was made for man's enjoyment and created not
as a beautiful spectacle, or spotless design, but as a field to be improved upon.'

A submission by an Australian scientific body regarding the human impact on the Australian
environment f,
The human impact on the environment is a function not only of population, but also of lifestyle, r%-
organisation and technology ... Any rise in population will increase the necessity and urgency to
do what already needs to be done to enhance Australia's population 'carrying capacity'1. Resource
and infrastructure issues, especially regarding water and energy use and waste disposal, already :
require more attention if Australia is to achieve an ecologically sustainable? way of life. If these
issues are not adequately addressed, Australia can expect further degradation of land and water
resources in certain regions of the coastal zone and on inland river systems, compromising its
quality of life - even at current population levels.

A perspective on migration to Australia written by immigrant RJ Mann in 1849
The Australian colonies present an almost boundless field for the industry1 of man. All who are
willing and able to work may live, and live well, there. The country is in most places in a state of
natural pasture, growing food suf icient for flocks and herds without limit. A large proportion of it
is fertile open land, fit for the plough, where a man with a hoe?, and the labour of a few days, may
'chip' into the earth sufficient maize® or Indian corn to sustain him for the entire year. Starvation is
unknown in Australia.

Ahistorical interpretation of the cause and effect of government legislation on Aboriginal and Torres
Strait Islander Peoples
The influence of racial ideas and attitudes, which cast Aborigines as a primitive, childlike race
that was doomed to 'disappear', deepened in the closing decades of the nineteenth century, and
discriminatory legislation was introduced by several mainland colonies or States . . which was
similar to an Act previously passed in Victoria (1869). These Acts established agencies upon which
these governments gradually conferred' greater regulatory powers, and so they increasingly
determined the lot? of a growing number of Aborigines in settled areas.

An Immigration Department official in Canberra said yesterday that arrangements were being
made for Qantas to fly the refugees to Australia.
He said that three Australian immigration officials were in Hong Kong processing applications from
refugees wishing to come to Australia.
There was no information as to how many more applications had been approved. :5""

Principles of the Ballarat Reform League in the lead up to the Eureka Stockade
At a Meeting held on Bakery Hill in the presence of about ten thousand men on Saturday
November 11th, 1854 the following were adopted as the principles and objects of the
Reform League"".
That it is the inalienable' right of every citizen to have a voice in making the laws he is called upon
to obey - that taxation without representation is tyranny?.
That, being as the people have been hitherto®, unrepresented in the Legislative Council of the
Colony of Victoria, they have been tyrannised over, and it becomes their duty as well as interest to
resist, and if necessary to remove the irresponsible power which so tyrannises over them.
That this Colony has hitherto been governed by paid Officials, upon the false assumption that law
is greater than justice because, forsooth?, it was made by them and their friends, and admirably
suits their selfish ends and narrow minded views. It is the object of the ""League"" to place the power
in the hands of responsible representatives of the people to frame wholesome laws and carry on an
© honest Government.

Ahistorical interpretation of the expansion of new unionism
During the 1880s Australian trade unionism underwent a substantial expansion. Whereas trade
unionism had been considered primarily the preserve of ' skilled tradesmen, it spread in the
1880s amongst previously unorganised semi and unskilled workers, notably the shearers, metal
miners, and railwaymen .. it was labelled the 'new unionism' ... [and] became associated with the
other major phenomena2 of the labour movement at this time, the apparent heightening of class
consciousness and the establishment of the Labor Party in the 1890s.

We, the leaders of the Gurindji people, write to you about our earnest' desire to regain tenure?
of our tribal lands in the Wave Hill-Limbunya area of the Northern Territory, of which we were
dispossessed in time past, and for which we received no recompense3.
Our people have lived here from time immemorial* and our culture, myths, dreaming and sacred
places have evolved in this land. Many of our forefathers were killed in the early days while trying to
retain it. Therefore we feel that morally the land is ours and should be returned to us.

An extract from The Argus, a Melbourne newspaper, after the declaration of war, 6 August 1914
In an incredibly short time after the first copy had been sold, everyone in the street seemed to have
heard the news of the declaration of war. Some were enthusiastic, some evidently gratified'; some
seemed ovt-zrweighted2 by the import3 of the news, some were openly pessimistic"". But the general
feeling was one of relief that the terrible waiting and uncertainty of the last few days was over,
and that, whatever the issue might be, Great Britain had made her voice known in the quarrel5 of
the nations.

Ahistorian's interpretation about life on the home front during World War
Labor had introduced so many rules designed, no doubt, to save resources and equalise hardship,
but in themselves often petty and irksome. Shoppers, for example, discovered that only parcels
above a specified size and weight might be delivered while even the butcher's boy on his pushbike
could make deliveries only on approved days. Aimost every area of homefront life suffered from
similar regulations and rules ..
Throughout 1944 and 1945 the determination to prosper out of the war grew and, if some people
still worked devotedly for patriotic causes, others turned to racecourses or the black market.
Commentators were dazed by the pursuit of pleasure and the large sums of money some people
would spend for poor quality alcohol or still dreary2 meals ..
. Rationing and austerity®, strict regulation of the workforce and questions of morality all turned on
perceptions of how well-off the other fellow was.

A historian's interpretation of the significance of the Dreaming
The Dreaming has two rules: obey the Law, and leave the world as you found it ... In most other
societies an urge for change is so entrenched1 as to be thought natural ... [It is not] clear that people
entirely succeeded in leaving the world as they found it, but they dedicated their lives to conserving
what they inherited, and within the perception of living generations generally they succeeded.
Since creator ancestors made all the land, no land can be wilderness ... Every hill, plain, rock and
tree is alive with story and imagery, and filled with presences2.

An interpretation by climate scientists and historians of why Earth has entered the Anthropocene
Climate change has brought into sharp focus the capability of contemporary human civilization
to influence the environment at the scale of the Earth as a single, evolving planetary system.
Following the discovery of the ozone hole over Antarctica, with its undeniably anthropogenic1
cause, the realization that the emission of large quantities of a colourless, odourless gas such
as carbon dioxide (CO2) can affect the energy balance at the Earth's surface has reinforced the
concern that human activity can adversely2 affect the broad range of ecosystem services that
support human (and other) life ... In addition to the carbon cycle, humans are ... likely driving the
sixth major extinction event in Earth history. Taken together, these trends are strong evidence that
humankind ... now rivals some of the great forces of Nature in its impact on the functioning of the
Earth system.

A historian's perspective on the implementation of the Immigration Restriction Act 1901 (White
Australia policy)
The White Australia policy was a declaration by those who had come to Australia from Britain, and
by their descendants born in Australia, that they intended to hold the continent for British Australians
against the world. In particular, they intended to hold it against the likely alternatives: an Australia
of mixed cultures and races, with the possibility of a Chinese majority if the doors were left open,
an Australia dominated by one of the other European empires. The cultural differences that must
result from the first of these alternatives, they believed, would not be compatible with a functioning
democracy based on universal suffrage, and the second was simply intolerable.

A speech by Senator Gareth Evans, then-Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, in 1988 on the passing
of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948
The Universal Declaration [of Human Rights] was the first, and remains the most important,
international human-rights instrument to proclaim1 fundamental human rights, and to allocate to
human rights a prominent place on the international agenda.
In my speech at the United Nations two months ago, I recalled the prominent role in the adoption
of the Universal Declaration played by an even more obsessive predecessor2 of mine, Herbert
Vere Evatt. Evatt was way ahead of his time in his clear perception of the need to establish a body3
of international law to protect the human rights of individuals. He recognised that human rights
concerned above all individuals facing fear, intimidation or threats to their life - all of them in dire
need of help and protection - and the victims of human-rights violations were the proper concern
of all governments and the international community acting together.

A perspective on the treatment of asylum seekers and boat people in 2004
A full judicial inquiry into the so called ""children overboard"" affair must now be conducted after the
next election, regardless of which party forms government.
Revelations1 on Monday morning confirm the view ... about the manufactured crisis of boat arrivals
since 2001, that the Australian public deserve a full, frank2 and independent judicial inquiry.
Over recent years there have been a succession of inquiries that have revealed disturbing facts
and information about our treatment of boat people and asylum seekers generally.
Since the Tampa incident many Australians have become increasingly concerned with the
government's policies regarding asylum seekers. These policies have and continue to cause
massive and unnecessary trauma.
An inquiry would help ensure that if boats start to come again, we will get our responses right. But
importantly, the critical healing process for the victims of the Government's policies requires that we
uncover the truth about the events of recent years.

A historian's interpretation of the Harvester Judgement and the establishment of the basic wage
Higgins determined that [a fair and reasonable] wage should be sufficient to maintain a man as
'human being in a civilized community'; furthermore ... it must provide for the needs of a family.
He therefore used household budgets to work out the cost of housing, clothing, food, transport,
books ... for a family of five, and declared this a minimum wage for an unskilled male labourer
... the principles of Higgins' Harvester judgement became a fundamental feature of national life.
Wages were to be determined not by bargaining but by an independent arbitrator1. They were
to be based not on profits or productivity but human need. They were premised on the male
breadwinner2, with men's wages sufficient to support a family ... Women contested the dual
standard for the next sixty years.

A historian's interpretation of the developments and achievements of Aboriginal nationalism
Indigenous rights ... had become a powerful force in politicising Aboriginal people and binding
disparate1 groups into a national movement. An Aboriginal flag ... was raised all over the country.
The fight ... emboldened2 Aboriginal people and gave them confidence through a shared sense of
injustice ... [Historian] Russell McGregor has termed this an Aboriginal nationalism.
People across the country marched, occupied sites, formed committees and petitioned parliaments
Appeals were made to the United Nations from 1970 onwards
Aboriginal people forged links with groups overseas, which deepened their justifications for
Indigenous rights and developed emerging ideas of Aboriginal sovereignty ... Indigenous global
networks emerged in the 1970s and ideas were exchanged to improve Indigenous lives worldwide.

A perspective on the oppression experienced by gay and lesbian people in the early 1970s
Homosexuals encounter oppression of three kinds: persecution, discrimination and tolerance
The gayworld1 ... is constantly harassed by police. Homosexuals learn the places to be avoided
because they are commonly visited by the vice squad2
Indeed anyone in a position where he/she is likely to be suspected a homosexual can expect
rough police treatment. I was once stopped and searched ... by two policemen because they saw
me walking with a friend
One can be refused a job, of course, without the real reason being stated ... many men are
refused promotion because they lack a respectable family image ... many women because they
seem ""too masculine""
The most common form of oppression ... tends to be neither outright persecution or discrimination
but rather [a] patronizing3 tolerance ... The difference between tolerance and acceptance is very
considerable, for tolerance is a [gift] extended by the superior to the inferior.

A historian's interpretation of the Curtin government's decision to extend the boundaries in which
Australian conscripts could serve
[In] 1942 the issue which had divided Australia in 1916 and 1917 re-emerged: conscription for
overseas service
There had been calls for conscription for overseas service from very early in [World War II].
1942 the Australian army was made up of two parts - the volunteer A.I.F. (Australian Imperial
Force), who could be sent to fight anywhere; and the conscripted A.M.F. (Australian Military Force1)
which could be compelled2 to serve only on Australian territory. But in 1939 ... the Defence Act had
been amended to include parts of New Guinea ... [In] 1942 Prime Minister Curtin decided that
single army was needed, and that it must be able to be sent beyond New Guinea. To achieve this,
the Defence Act would need to be amended
... [In] January 1943 Curtin was authorised by his party to ... make the appropriate amendment to
the Defence Act

A historical interpretation of Australia's involvement in the war in the Indo-Malayan region
during the 1950s
[The] Malayan Emergency was declared ... in response to the murder of three estate managers
... by guerrillas1 of the Malayan Communist Party (MCP), which had determined2 on the violent
overthrow of the British colonial government
Australian involvement in the Emergency began ... in response to a request from the British
government
Australian ground forces arrived in Malaya in October 1955 to form part of the Australian
contribution to ... deter external communist aggression
Confrontation, or Konfrontasi in Indonesian, was a small undeclared war ... through which
President Sukarno of Indonesia sought to destabilise3 and ultimately destroy the new Federation
of Malaysia
The Australian government was extremely wary of involving its troops in conflict with Indonesia
... [due to the] border that Indonesia shared with Papua New Guinea.
