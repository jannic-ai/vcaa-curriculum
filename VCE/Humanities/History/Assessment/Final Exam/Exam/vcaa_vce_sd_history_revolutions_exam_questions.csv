An extract from the pamphlet Common Sense, written by Thomas Paine and published in the colonies
in January 1776
have heard it asserted' by some, that as America has flourished? under her former connection
with Great-Britain, the same connection is necessary towards her future happiness ... Nothing can
be more fallacious® than this kind of argument ... America would have flourished as much, and
probably much more, had no European power taken any notice of her .
But Britain is the parent country, say some. Then the more shame upon her conduct. Even brutes
do not devour their young, nor savages make war upon their families .
A government of our own is our natural right .. . it is infinitely® wiser and safer, to form a constitution
of our own in a cool deliberate manner, while we have it in our power, than to trust such an
interesting event to time and chance.

Ahistorical interpretation, published in 2011, outlining some of the challenges facing Native Americans
before and after 1776
.. [C]hallenges confronting Native Americans . . became acute at the end of the Seven Years' War
as numerous British American settlers pushed westward, encroaching on' Indian? lands ..
Tensions between European settlers and Native Americans were subsumed® by the subsequent
conflict between the British and their North American colonists. When the War of Independence
began, Native Americans found themselves in a position of relative (and temporary) power as
both the British and the American rebels sought to cultivate® their support .. . [But] With the rebel
victory in the war, Native Americans were confronted by a new, more dangerous situation. The
United States, which had secured capacious5 boundaries at the Peace of Paris, and, possessed
of a growing population determined to settle western lands, posed a mortal® threat to the Native
Americans, who could no longer count on the support of Britain.

A historical interpretation, published in 2009, outlining the reasons for amendments to the American
Constitution. These amendments became the Bill of Rights.
Antipathy' toward a strong central government was only one concern among those opposed to the
Constitution; of equal concern to many was the fear that the Constitution did not protect individual
rights and freedoms sufficiently ... Indeed, five states, including Massachusetts, ratified? the
Constitution on the condition that such amendments be added immediately.
When the first Congress convened in New York City in September 1789, the calls for amendments
protecting individual rights were virtually unanimous®. Congress quickly adopted 12 such
amendments; by December 1791, enough states had ratified 10 amendments to make them part
of the Constitution. Collectively, they are known as the Bill of Rights. Among their provisions®:
freedom of speech, press, religion, and the right to assemble peacefully, protest, and demand
changes (First Amendment) ..

before 1789
When funds ran low she repeatedly went to the King, who usually indulged"" her. As a young woman
she indulged a weakness for diamonds that ... earned her a smart rap over the knuckles? . from

This is a letter written in December 1793 by Collot d'Herbois describing his attempts to defeat
rebellion in Lyon, France's second largest city. Collot was a member of the Committee of Public Safety
and was one of 82 members of the National Convention sent to ensure that its laws were followed
throughout France.

Ahistorical interpretation of the leadership of Lenin, published in 2010
Lenin was an exceptional' figure. He founded .. the Bolsheviks, which he turned into a party
that made the October Revolution of 1917. The world's first socialist state . . survived against the
odds. Lenin and the communist leadership withdrew Russia from the First World War and won the
Civil War ..
.. In 1921 he introduced the New Economic Policy and saved the Soviet state from being
overwhelmed by popular rebellion . .
.. Lenin created the Cheka .. Lenin justified dictatorship and terror .
And .. . while Lenin was cunning and untrustworthy, he was also dedicated to the ultimate? goal of
communism. He enjoyed power; he lusted after® it . . But he wanted power for a purpose. He was
determined that the Bolsheviks should initiate the achievement of a world without exploitation* and
oppression® ..
But .. [Lenin] never ceased to declare that revolutions did not simply happen: they had to be made.
And this required leadership.

Ahistorical interpretation of the Chinese Civil War, published in 2016
After some seemingly impressive successes in the first year of the war, the Nationalists
[Guomindang/Kuomintang] were unable to achieve a single major victory between 1947 and
1949. Faced by growing desertions, and betrayed by some of his higher officers, who passed to
the Communists details of Nationalist troop positions and movements, Jiar\g1 could never wholly
rely on his supposed supporters, a problem that rarely troubled Mao Zedong. Unable to sustain
a genuinely popular fol
owing, Jiang increasingly resorted to coercion? as the war went on ..
August 1948, Shanghai witnessed particularly bloody scenes, including street-corner beheadings
and shootings by government troops. Such atrocities® alienated"" the Nationalists' diminishing®
band of supporters . .

In colleges and schools across China, teachers were attacked by pupils. Some were tortured
and, in extreme cases, murdered, often in the most barbarous' ways .. Professors and
scholars who escaped with their lives were sentenced to clean toilets. Aimost 400,000 people
branded? as rightists were forced to leave cities and return to the villages from which they or their
parents had come ..

films and theatrical performances allowed were those approved by Jiang Qinga; a total of just 124

out of bounds - women wore .. flat heels and most people donned* Red Guard-style green
uniform jackets, baggy trousers and caps . .

An extract from a letter written to a British merchant in December 1765, signed by Thomas Cushing,
James Otis, Samuel Adams and Thomas Gray, who were members of the Massachusetts Assembly
The Colonists have as great a Regard1 for Right, Liberty and Justice as any People under
Heaven-and they generally have Knowledge enough to discover when their Rights are infringed
They hold themselves intitled2 to all the inherent3, unalienable4 Rights of Nature, as Men-
and to all the essential Rights of Britons, as subjects ... The primary, absolute, natural Rights of
Englishmen as frequently declared in Acts of Parliament from Magna Charta5 to this Day, are
Personal Security, Personal Liberty and Private Property ... It is a fundamental Principle of the
British Constitution that the supreme Power6 cannot take from any Man any Part of his Property
without his Consent in Person or by Representation.

A historical interpretation, published in 2020, of the colonial reaction to the Coercive Acts passed by the
British parliament following the Boston Tea Party
[C]olonists had to await Britain's reaction to the fate of the ships. News of that reaction first arrived
in mid-May [1774], with further details trickling in over the next few months. Americans learned that
Parliament had closed the port of Boston until the tea was paid for, then followed up with a series of
punitive1 laws known as the Coercive Acts.
During the summer of 1774, Americans everywhere discussed the appropriate response to
such parliamentary measures, leading to the convening2 of the (First) Continental Congress in
September. Before adjourning3 in late October, the congressmen adopted resolutions on the
controversy and, more important, called for the creation of a series of local committees to enforce
trade boycott of Great Britain. Throughout the rest of the year, the committees worked to establish
their legitimacy and, in conjunction with newly elected provincial congresses, began to challenge
the authority of the existing colonial governments.

A historical interpretation, published in 2013, outlining the treatment of Loyalists during and after the
War of Independence
[The Treaty of Paris 1783] made no mention of loyal white Americans outside of a meaningless
clause in Article V that required the rebel Congress to ""earnestly recommend"" that each state
legislature ""provide for the restitution1 of all estates, rights, and properties which have been
confiscated belonging to real British subjects""
Throughout the war, colonial governments had enacted laws confiscating the property of prominent
loyalists. Because the states and not the Congress had seized the property, Congress had no
power to deal with the question of loyalist reparations2. It could not enforce the restoration of seized
loyalist property or compel liberal treatment3 of returning loyalists. This meant, as both loyalists and
the victorious rebels understood, that the loyalists would receive no mercy
Anti-loyalist activity went unpunished in local neighborhoods. Angry residents used every
means in their power-intimidation, assault, tarring and feathering-to prevent the exiles from
returning home.

An extract from the pamphlet titled What is the Third Estate?, written by Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès and
published at the beginning of 1789
This document is set out quite simply. We have three questions to ask ourselves.
1.	What is the Third Estate?-everything.
2.	What has it been until now in the political order?-nothing.
3.	What is it asking?-to be something.
Who would thus dare to say that the Third Estate does not contain everything that is needed to
make up a complete nation? ... If the privileged orders were removed, the nation would not be
worse off for it, but better. So, what is the Third [Estate]? Everything, but a fettered1 and oppressed
everything. What would it be without the privileged order? ... Nothing can happen without it;
everything would be infinitely better without the others.

A historical interpretation, published in 2003, outlining some of the events occurring at the
Estates-General, including the Tennis Court Oath in 1789
On the 17th [June] ... the Third [Estate] took the title National Assembly by a vote of 491 to 90
there had been rumours that the Estates would be dismissed and the financial crisis resolved by
new loans ... The lawyers in the Third Estate had become revolutionaries.
Necker finally persuaded Louis XVI to try to take the matter in hand1 by holding a royal session
of all three orders
The bungling2 of the preparations for the royal session only reinforced the National Assembly's
resolution to stand firm ... When the deputies arrived on the morning of the 20th to find placards3
closing the assembly hall ... many immediately concluded that a formal dissolution was imminent4.
Angered at the contempt5 for their rights ... they went to a nearby enclosed tennis court and there
took an oath not to separate from the National Assembly ... until they had established a constitution
for the kingdom. The Tennis Court Oath was one of the great days of the Revolution ... The oath
was a symbol of national unity ... and it reaffirmed the assumption of sovereignty the National
Assembly took on ... the 17th.
Equally important, the oath undermined the King's solution even before it was offered.

A historical interpretation, published in 1975, outlining the new regime's economic challenges in 1793
Revolutionary France had scarcely1 declared war on the monarchies of Europe when ... she was
faced with a foreign coalition and military defeat, with aristocratic counter-revolution and civil war,
with an economic crisis and a popular upsurge2
The financial crisis was made worse by the continual issuing of new assignats3 which led to a rapid
rise in the cost of living
The decline in the value of the currency continued unchecked, made worse by the impact of the
King's execution and by the effects of a European war
As a result of this the food crisis could only grow worse. Wage-earners were paid on average
20 sous4 per day in the country areas and 40 in Paris. In certain areas bread cost as much as
8 sous per pound5, and all other goods ... were undergoing similar price increases. Not only was
bread expensive; it was also scarce.

A historical interpretation, published in 2022, outlining some decisions made by Alexander Kerensky in
the months leading up to October 1917
Kerensky was well aware of the Bolsheviks' preparations, but even they could not shake his
complacency1. He told the British ambassador, Sir George Buchanan, 'I only wish that they
would come out, and I will then put them down.' On 20 October, he boasted ... that he welcomed
Bolshevik revolt, because they would be utterly defeated. The same day the minister for war,
General Aleksandr Verkhovsky, warned Kerensky that the army was incapable of fighting, so the
best policy would be to open negotiations with the Germans and steal the Bolsheviks' thunder2.
Kerensky angrily rejected the idea and sacked3 him
On the basis of faulty information ... the government prepared for an uprising, first on 17 October,
then on 20 October, and once more two days later. 'Rumours are more and more persistently
being spread,' wrote Gorky4 on 18 October, 'that some ""action by the Bolsheviks"" will take place
on 20 October; in other words, the disgusting scenes of 3-5 July may be repeated.' ... Kerensky
preferred to think that the Bolsheviks' nerve would again fail as it had in July.

A historical interpretation, published in 1986, about the purpose of the policy of War Communism
after June 1918
In speech after speech Lenin first urged, then announced, the sending of detachments of
'thousands and thousands' of 'politically advanced' workers from the two capitals to the
countryside, to head the food requisitioning detachments
This attitude to the products of the peasantry is often spoken of as 'War Communism', the
implication being that it was an emergency policy dictated by the exigencies1 of the Civil War. This
is quite untrue. Not only had the Civil War not really started at the time of the original decrees, but
Lenin in June 1918 already defined the grain monopoly2 from a quite different point of view
That is to say, far from being a 'war' measure the 'War Communism' policy was a conscious
attempt to create a new social order, to effect the immediate transformation of the country into
full socialism.

It was not until the Second World War, when the New Life Movement developed offshoots such as
the Wounded Soldiers League, that it began to make any significant contribution to the country.
Meanwhile, as the American minister, Nelson T. Johnson, noted, ""It is doubtful whether the
personalities interested in the movement are sufficiently pure themselves to give the movement
much prestige.""

This extract is from a political report by Chairman Mao Zedong (Mao Tse-tung) to the Seventh
National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) on 24 April 1945. In his report, he makes
comparison between the strategies of the Guomindang (Kuomintang) forces and the Red Army during
the Sino-Japanese War.
[T]here exist in China two different guiding lines: one of which helps to defeat the Japanese
aggressors, but the other ... in some respects actually helps them to undermine the
anti-Japanese war.
The passive policy adopted by the KMT1 government towards the war with Japan and its
reactionary2 policy of oppression towards the people have resulted in military defeats, the loss of
large parts of territory, a financial and economic crisis, the oppression of the people, hardships in
the people's livelihood, and the undermining of national unity
In the liberated areas [areas taken by the Communists], all anti-Japanese people in labour,
peasant, youth, women's cultural, and other organizations, under the leadership of a democratic
government, are engaging themselves heartily3 in various work to help the army, such as
mobilizing people to join the army, transporting supplies for the troops, giving preferential treatment
to the families of soldiers, and solving material difficulties for the troops.

A historical interpretation, published in 2003, by two economists outlining the directions taken in the
Second Five-Year Plan, also known as the Great Leap Forward
Starting from the summer of 1958, China was to experience in the next few years one of the most
radical revolutionary changes in the history of mankind-the Great Leap Forward ... the Leap was
an unorthodox1 development strategy conceived to hasten the pace of transforming the Chinese
economy from its predominantly agrarian2 nature into a powerful industrial state ... a specific
objective of the Leap was to increase both agricultural and industrial output by manifolds3, the
former by expanding the acreage4 covered by irrigation and the latter via increasing the capacity
of steel and iron production. As China was severely constrained with capital5 and backward
in technology, achieving rapid growth via technical change was an unlikely option. An obvious
alternative, given China's abundant surplus rural workers, was to make greater use of these
resources by mobilizing them to engage in a variety of industrial and public projects through the
restructuring of work and other aspects of social organization
