This extract is a historical interpretation that describes the results of Thutmosis I I's military campaigns.
Thutmose' I I's military successes brought an influx of wealth into the Egyptian economy. Taxes
and tribute came from lands as far apart as Nubia, Retennu,? Babylon and Naharin,®and from the
Hit ites and the Keftiu (The Minoans). This allowed one of the most prolific building programs in
Egyptian history.
Thutmose's devotion to the gods of ancient Egypt, especially Amen? of Thebes, resulted in the
rebuilding and embellishment® of many of the key religious sites in Egypt at that time. Forts were
constructed, canals reopened and naval ports expanded. For over 50 years Thutmose dominated
Egypt and the Near East and was respected by the Egyptians so much that 500 years later
Pinudjem | of the 21st Dynasty named his son after him.

This is an extract from an inscription that was carved on a stela at Abydos. It describes how Ahmose I,
the founder of the Eighteenth Dynasty, honoured his grandmother, Tetisheri.
Now, it came to pass that his majesty sat in the audience-hall . . the King of Upper and Lower
Egypt, Nebpehtire, Son of Re, Ahmose (1), given life; while the hereditary princess, great in favor,
great in amiability, king''s-daughter, king's-sister, divine consort, great king's-wife, Ahmose-
Nefretiri, who liveth,2 was with his majesty.
The king himself spake? to her: ""I, it is, who have remembered the mother of my mother, and the
mother of my father, great king's-wife and king's-mother, Tetisheri . . triumphant. (Although) she
already has a tomb . . and a mortuary chapel . . on the soil of Thebes and Abydos, | have said this
to thee,* in that my majesty has desired to have made for her (also) a pyramid and a house ..
Tazeser, as a monumental donation of my majesty. Its lake shall be dug, its trees shall be planted,
its offerings shall be founded, equipped with people, endowed with® lands, presented with herds,
mortuary priests and ritual priests having their duties, every man knowing his stipulation.""®
.. His majesty did this because he so greatly loved her, beyond everything.

This extract is a historical interpretation that describes the key features of tyranny in Ancient Greece.
.. from the mid seventh century a series of usurpers began to seize autocratic power in the more
advanced cities, establishing dynasties which usually lasted for some two generations before they
were overthrown and replaced by hoplite'-dominated governments . . Thus for a century or more
after about 650, tyranny was one of the prevalent forms of government in the Greek cities . . During
this period it was also the tyrants who dominated the political and artistic life of the Greek world, and
who captured the popular imagination in tradition. The experience of tyranny created a fascination
and a hatred which permanently influenced Greek political attitudes against monarchy .
.. tyranny is defined as absolute rule exercised contrary to customary law,2 or at the whim? of the
ruler; and it is contrasted with kingship, which is absolute rule in accordance with customary law,
or for the benefit of the subjects. Itis regarded . as the worst possible form of government, worse
even than mob-rule, with which indeed it is held to have some connection.

This extract from Aristotle describes the personality of Cleon.
After the death of Pericles, Nicias, who later died in Sicily, became the leader of the aristocratic
party, and Cleon, the son of Cleaenetus, the leader of the people. This man, more than anybody
else, appears to have corrupted the people by his violent methods. He was the first who shouted on
the public platform, who used abusive language and who spoke with his cloak girt"" up about him,
while all the others used to speak in proper dress and manner.

This extract is a historical interpretation that describes the powers of the consuls in the
Roman Republic.
The consuls .. consult the senate on matters of urgency [and] carry out in detail the provisions of
its decrees. Again as concerns all affairs of state administered by the people it is their duty to take
these under their charge, to summon assemblies, to introduce measures, and to preside over the
execution of the popular decrees. As for preparation for war and the general conduct of operations
in the field, here their power is almost uncontrolled; for they are empowered to make what demands
they choose on the allies, to appoint military tribunes, to levy soldiers and select those who are
fittest for service. They also have the right of inflicting, when on active service, punishment on
anyone under their command; and they are authorized to spend any sum they decide upon from the
public funds, being accompanied by a quaestor! who faithfully executes their instructions.

1quaestor - a magistracy with financial and administrative duties
Source
This is a historical interpretation that outlines some of the political changes that occurred after the
Revolution of 509 BCE.
The establishment of the Roman Republic was due either to revolution or evolution; it was either
the effect or the cause of the fall of the monarchy . . the monarchy was abolished and two annual
magistrates named consuls . . were established in its place ..
.. With their subordinate officers they were responsible for the financial and general administration
of the state. This supreme executive authority, which was a basic constitutional conception,! was
conferred by the Comitia Curiata . . Later magistrates, e.g. censors and aediles, who took over
some of the consuls' duties, did not obtain imperium.?
In addition to the regular magistrates was the extraordinary office of dictator ..
Thus the Romans had provided an executive by creating a regular magistracy together with an
extraordinary emergency one. This executive was expected by custom to rely largely on the Council
of Elders and in practice it did . . Finally, of the two Assemblies of the People the Comitia Centuriata
gained increasing political influence and took over many of the functions of the Comitia Curiata ...

Newspaper report on the establishment of the Royal National Park, published in 1879
Itis indeed somewhat strange that so large an area of Crown land', possessed of such natural
beauties, within fourteen miles of a populous city, should have remained so long unknown,
unvisited, and unappropriated2
.. Between the creek and the sea is a coast range of the usual sandstone formation . . The park
therefore will contain a great variety of grand and beautiful features .. it has the sandstone slopes,
with their peculiar forms and vegetation, with which the travellers on the Blue Mountains are now
familiar. It has in the valleys one attraction, no longer to be found in the well-known gulleys® of the
Blue Mountains, namely, splendid specimens of Australian timber.

Ahistorian's interpretation of how settlers justified moving into Aboriginal land
Anormal justification for settlers in moving onto Aboriginal lands was a reference to the Bible, and
in particular to God's Old Testament instruction to go forth and multiply and subdue' the earth,
quoted by the Herald? in the wake of the Myall Creek trials®, The Aborigines had failed to subdue
the earth and thus left it open to those who were willing to. Christopher Hodgson, a parson's4 son
who had farmed the Darling Downs west of Brisbane, wrote of his years in Australia, 'Thus far the
creator of the universe is just, in that He allows the superiority of civilisation over barbarism®,
intellect over instinct or brutish® reason . . the world was made for man's enjoyment and created not
as a beautiful spectacle, or spotless design, but as a field to be improved upon.'

A submission by an Australian scientific body regarding the human impact on the Australian
environment f,
The human impact on the environment is a function not only of population, but also of lifestyle, r%-
organisation and technology ... Any rise in population will increase the necessity and urgency to
do what already needs to be done to enhance Australia's population 'carrying capacity'1. Resource
and infrastructure issues, especially regarding water and energy use and waste disposal, already :
require more attention if Australia is to achieve an ecologically sustainable? way of life. If these
issues are not adequately addressed, Australia can expect further degradation of land and water
resources in certain regions of the coastal zone and on inland river systems, compromising its
quality of life - even at current population levels.

A perspective on migration to Australia written by immigrant RJ Mann in 1849
The Australian colonies present an almost boundless field for the industry1 of man. All who are
willing and able to work may live, and live well, there. The country is in most places in a state of
natural pasture, growing food suf icient for flocks and herds without limit. A large proportion of it
is fertile open land, fit for the plough, where a man with a hoe?, and the labour of a few days, may
'chip' into the earth sufficient maize® or Indian corn to sustain him for the entire year. Starvation is
unknown in Australia.

Ahistorical interpretation of the cause and effect of government legislation on Aboriginal and Torres
Strait Islander Peoples
The influence of racial ideas and attitudes, which cast Aborigines as a primitive, childlike race
that was doomed to 'disappear', deepened in the closing decades of the nineteenth century, and
discriminatory legislation was introduced by several mainland colonies or States . . which was
similar to an Act previously passed in Victoria (1869). These Acts established agencies upon which
these governments gradually conferred' greater regulatory powers, and so they increasingly
determined the lot? of a growing number of Aborigines in settled areas.

Principles of the Ballarat Reform League in the lead up to the Eureka Stockade
At a Meeting held on Bakery Hill in the presence of about ten thousand men on Saturday
November 11th, 1854 the following were adopted as the principles and objects of the
Reform League"".
That it is the inalienable' right of every citizen to have a voice in making the laws he is called upon
to obey - that taxation without representation is tyranny?.
That, being as the people have been hitherto®, unrepresented in the Legislative Council of the
Colony of Victoria, they have been tyrannised over, and it becomes their duty as well as interest to
resist, and if necessary to remove the irresponsible power which so tyrannises over them.
That this Colony has hitherto been governed by paid Officials, upon the false assumption that law
is greater than justice because, forsooth?, it was made by them and their friends, and admirably
suits their selfish ends and narrow minded views. It is the object of the ""League"" to place the power
in the hands of responsible representatives of the people to frame wholesome laws and carry on an
© honest Government.

Ahistorical interpretation of the expansion of new unionism
During the 1880s Australian trade unionism underwent a substantial expansion. Whereas trade
unionism had been considered primarily the preserve of ' skilled tradesmen, it spread in the
1880s amongst previously unorganised semi and unskilled workers, notably the shearers, metal
miners, and railwaymen .. it was labelled the 'new unionism' ... [and] became associated with the
other major phenomena2 of the labour movement at this time, the apparent heightening of class
consciousness and the establishment of the Labor Party in the 1890s.

We, the leaders of the Gurindji people, write to you about our earnest' desire to regain tenure?

dispossessed in time past, and for which we received no recompense3.
Our people have lived here from time immemorial* and our culture, myths, dreaming and sacred
places have evolved in this land. Many of our forefathers were killed in the early days while trying to
retain it. Therefore we feel that morally the land is ours and should be returned to us.

An extract from The Argus, a Melbourne newspaper, after the declaration of war, 6 August 1914
In an incredibly short time after the first copy had been sold, everyone in the street seemed to have
heard the news of the declaration of war. Some were enthusiastic, some evidently gratiﬁed'; some
seemed ovt-zrweighted2 by the import3 of the news, some were openly pessimistic"". But the general
feeling was one of relief that the terrible waiting and uncertainty of the last few days was over,
and that, whatever the issue might be, Great Britain had made her voice known in the quarrel5 of
the nations.

Ahistorian's interpretation about life on the home front during World War
Labor had introduced so many rules designed, no doubt, to save resources and equalise hardship,
but in themselves often petty and irksome. Shoppers, for example, discovered that only parcels
above a specified size and weight might be delivered while even the butcher's boy on his pushbike
could make deliveries only on approved days. Aimost every area of homefront life suffered from
similar regulations and rules ..
Throughout 1944 and 1945 the determination to prosper out of the war grew and, if some people
still worked devotedly for patriotic causes, others turned to racecourses or the black market.
Commentators were dazed by the pursuit of pleasure and the large sums of money some people
would spend for poor quality alcohol or still dreary2 meals ..
. Rationing and austerity®, strict regulation of the workforce and questions of morality all turned on
perceptions of how well-off the other fellow was.

in January 1776
have heard it asserted' by some, that as America has flourished? under her former connection
with Great-Britain, the same connection is necessary towards her future happiness ... Nothing can
be more fallacious® than this kind of argument ... America would have flourished as much, and
probably much more, had no European power taken any notice of her .
But Britain is the parent country, say some. Then the more shame upon her conduct. Even brutes
do not devour their young, nor savages make war upon their families .

Ahistorical interpretation, published in 2011, outlining some of the challenges facing Native Americans
before and after 1776
.. [C]hallenges confronting Native Americans . . became acute at the end of the Seven Years' War
as numerous British American settlers pushed westward, encroaching on' Indian? lands ..
Tensions between European settlers and Native Americans were subsumed® by the subsequent
conflict between the British and their North American colonists. When the War of Independence
began, Native Americans found themselves in a position of relative (and temporary) power as
both the British and the American rebels sought to cultivate® their support .. . [But] With the rebel
victory in the war, Native Americans were confronted by a new, more dangerous situation. The
United States, which had secured capacious5 boundaries at the Peace of Paris, and, possessed
of a growing population determined to settle western lands, posed a mortal® threat to the Native
Americans, who could no longer count on the support of Britain.

A historical interpretation, published in 2009, outlining the reasons for amendments to the American
Constitution. These amendments became the Bill of Rights.
Antipathy' toward a strong central government was only one concern among those opposed to the
Constitution; of equal concern to many was the fear that the Constitution did not protect individual
rights and freedoms sufficiently ... Indeed, five states, including Massachusetts, ratified? the
Constitution on the condition that such amendments be added immediately.
When the first Congress convened in New York City in September 1789, the calls for amendments
protecting individual rights were virtually unanimous®. Congress quickly adopted 12 such
amendments; by December 1791, enough states had ratified 10 amendments to make them part
of the Constitution. Collectively, they are known as the Bill of Rights. Among their provisions®:
freedom of speech, press, religion, and the right to assemble peacefully, protest, and demand
changes (First Amendment) ..

This is a letter written in December 1793 by Collot d'Herbois describing his attempts to defeat
rebellion in Lyon, France's second largest city. Collot was a member of the Committee of Public Safety

throughout France.

Lenin was an exceptional' figure. He founded .. the Bolsheviks, which he turned into a party
that made the October Revolution of 1917. The world's first socialist state . . survived against the
odds. Lenin and the communist leadership withdrew Russia from the First World War and won the
Civil War ..
.. In 1921 he introduced the New Economic Policy and saved the Soviet state from being
overwhelmed by popular rebellion . .
.. Lenin created the Cheka .. Lenin justified dictatorship and terror .
And .. . while Lenin was cunning and untrustworthy, he was also dedicated to the ultimate? goal of
communism. He enjoyed power; he lusted after® it . . But he wanted power for a purpose. He was
determined that the Bolsheviks should initiate the achievement of a world without exploitation* and
oppression® ..
But .. [Lenin] never ceased to declare that revolutions did not simply happen: they had to be made.
And this required leadership.

After some seemingly impressive successes in the first year of the war, the Nationalists
[Guomindang/Kuomintang] were unable to achieve a single major victory between 1947 and
1949. Faced by growing desertions, and betrayed by some of his higher officers, who passed to
the Communists details of Nationalist troop positions and movements, Jiar\g1 could never wholly
rely on his supposed supporters, a problem that rarely troubled Mao Zedong. Unable to sustain
a genuinely popular fol
owing, Jiang increasingly resorted to coercion? as the war went on ..

Extract from a speech given by Mao Zedong (Mao Tse-tung) at the Eleventh Session of the Supreme
State Conference in February 1957
.. [Blecause the imperialists . . oppressed' and exploited us . ours is an impoverished? country
and the standard of living . . of our peasants . is still low .. In this context, it is right to say that
the peasants lead a ""hard life"". But in another sense it is not true ... As a matter of fact, with very
few exceptions, there has been some improvement in the life of .. the peasants . . Since liberation
[October 1949], the peasants have been free from landlord exploitation® and their production
has increased annually. Take grain crops. In 1949, the country's output was only something over
210,000 million catties®. By 1956, it had risen to more than 360,000 million catties . . The state
agricultural tax is not heavy, only amounting to something over 30,000 million catties a year.

Ahistorical interpretation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, published in 2013
In colleges and schools across China, teachers were attacked by pupils. Some were tortured
and, in extreme cases, murdered, often in the most barbarous' ways .. Professors and
scholars who escaped with their lives were sentenced to clean toilets. Aimost 400,000 people
branded? as rightists were forced to leave cities and return to the villages from which they or their
parents had come ..
.. At their places of work, staff bowed three times before his [Mao Zedong's/Mao Tse-tung's]
portrait. The Little Red Book was held to cure ilinesses . . Control was tightened. The only books,
films and theatrical performances allowed were those approved by Jiang Qinga; a total of just 124
novels were published during the Cultural Revolution. Any form of personal taste in clothing was
out of bounds - women wore .. flat heels and most people donned* Red Guard-style green
uniform jackets, baggy trousers and caps . .

This is a historical interpretation, published in 2013, which describes the military campaigns of
Thutmosis III. Details of the campaigns were carved in the Temple of Karnak and dedicated to
Amun (Amen-Ra).
The most extensive presentation of the Karnak temple as receiver of income from military
campaigns abroad is found in the annals of Thutmose III1 ... in a concluding text it is stated
that all prisoners made on the king's first campaign (including over 1,500 ""Syrians"") were given
to Amun, in order to serve him as temple weavers and cultivators ... that cows from Egyptian,
Levantine and Nubian herds were donated to Amun for his milk offerings ... that three Canaanite
towns were assigned to Amun, and were charged with a yearly tax that contributed to the divine
offering ... The donations appear as a natural consequence of the king's victories, which are
explicitly said to have been made possible by his father Amun.

And thought of my maker,
That my heart led me to make for him

This is an extract from the 'Earlier Proclamation', inscribed on the boundary stelae at Akhetaten in

Then said his Person1 to them: ""Behold Aten! The Aten wishes to have [something] made for him
as a monument with an eternal and everlasting name. Now it is the Aten, my father, who advised
me concerning it, (namely) Akhet-Aten2. No official had ever advised me concerning it, nor had any
people in the entire land ever advised me concerning it, to tell me [a plan] for making Akhet-Aten

the exercise of active political rights and from the possession of real property ... Yet they enjoyed

This extract from the Athenian historian Thucydides recounts part of the speech of the Spartan king
Archidamus discussing preparations for war against Athens.
'Peloponnesians and allies, our fathers have engaged in many campaigns both in and outside
the Peloponnese, and the elder men in this army of ours are not inexperienced in war. Yet we
have never marched out in greater strength than now ... the whole of Hellas1 is eagerly watching
this action of ours, and, because of the general hatred against Athens, wishing us success in our
undertakings
The best and safest thing of all is when a large force is so well disciplined that it seems to be
acting like one man.'

This extract from the Greek historian and biographer Plutarch describes Lysander's actions leading up
to the end of the Decelean (Ionian) War.
Lysander sailed to the various cities in the neighbourhood and ordered all the Athenians he
found to return to Athens, and he proclaimed that anybody caught outside the city would be put
to death without exception. This step, which drove all the Athenians into the capital at once, was
deliberately taken so as to produce intense scarcity and famine in Athens as soon as possible,
and to forestall the necessity for a siege, against which the Athenians might otherwise have been
well provided.
... [Lysander] learned that the people of Athens were suffering terribly from famine, and so he
sailed into the Piraeus and reduced the city, which was forced to accept the terms he laid down.

This extract from the Roman historian Livy describes the rivalry between Romulus and Remus over the
foundation of Rome.
Remus is said to have been the first to receive an omen: six vultures appeared to him. The augury1
had just been announced to Romulus when double the number appeared to him. Each was saluted
as king by his own party. The one side based their claim on the priority of the appearance, the other
on the number of the birds. Then followed an angry altercation; heated passions led to bloodshed;
in the tumult2 Remus was killed. The more common report is that Remus contemptuously3 jumped
over the newly raised walls and was forthwith killed by the enraged Romulus, who exclaimed,
shall it be henceforth with every one who leaps over my walls."" Romulus thus became sole ruler,
and the city was called after him, its founder.

constitution.
[W]hat part is left for the people in the constitution, when the senate has these various functions,
especially the control of the receipts and expenditure of the exchequer1; and when the consuls,
again, have absolute power over the details of military preparation, and an absolute authority in

This is a historical interpretation, published in 1978, which examines Pompey's unconventional rise to
political prominence in Ancient Rome.
On 12 March 81 [BCE] ... Pompey held his triumph. It was officially for his victory over Hiarbas1,
since his other victories had been over Roman citizens
More important from the historical point of view is the effect his triumph must have had on the other
political leaders of the time. Centuries of tradition decreed that the aspiring politician should
slowly work his way up the ladder of promotion
And yet here was a young soldier ... winning a dangerous amount of personal popularity
with the people.

A historian's interpretation of the significance of the Dreaming
The Dreaming has two rules: obey the Law, and leave the world as you found it ... In most other
societies an urge for change is so entrenched1 as to be thought natural ... [It is not] clear that people
entirely succeeded in leaving the world as they found it, but they dedicated their lives to conserving
what they inherited, and within the perception of living generations generally they succeeded.
Since creator ancestors made all the land, no land can be wilderness ... Every hill, plain, rock and
tree is alive with story and imagery, and filled with presences2.

An interpretation by climate scientists and historians of why Earth has entered the Anthropocene
Climate change has brought into sharp focus the capability of contemporary human civilization
to influence the environment at the scale of the Earth as a single, evolving planetary system.
Following the discovery of the ozone hole over Antarctica, with its undeniably anthropogenic1
cause, the realization that the emission of large quantities of a colourless, odourless gas such
as carbon dioxide (CO2) can affect the energy balance at the Earth's surface has reinforced the
concern that human activity can adversely2 affect the broad range of ecosystem services that
support human (and other) life ... In addition to the carbon cycle, humans are ... likely driving the
sixth major extinction event in Earth history. Taken together, these trends are strong evidence that
humankind ... now rivals some of the great forces of Nature in its impact on the functioning of the
Earth system.

A historian's perspective on the implementation of the Immigration Restriction Act 1901 (White
Australia policy)
The White Australia policy was a declaration by those who had come to Australia from Britain, and
by their descendants born in Australia, that they intended to hold the continent for British Australians
against the world. In particular, they intended to hold it against the likely alternatives: an Australia
of mixed cultures and races, with the possibility of a Chinese majority if the doors were left open,
an Australia dominated by one of the other European empires. The cultural differences that must
result from the first of these alternatives, they believed, would not be compatible with a functioning
democracy based on universal suffrage, and the second was simply intolerable.

A speech by Senator Gareth Evans, then-Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, in 1988 on the passing
of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948
The Universal Declaration [of Human Rights] was the first, and remains the most important,
international human-rights instrument to proclaim1 fundamental human rights, and to allocate to
human rights a prominent place on the international agenda.
In my speech at the United Nations two months ago, I recalled the prominent role in the adoption
of the Universal Declaration played by an even more obsessive predecessor2 of mine, Herbert
Vere Evatt. Evatt was way ahead of his time in his clear perception of the need to establish a body3
of international law to protect the human rights of individuals. He recognised that human rights
concerned above all individuals facing fear, intimidation or threats to their life - all of them in dire
need of help and protection - and the victims of human-rights violations were the proper concern
of all governments and the international community acting together.

A perspective on the treatment of asylum seekers and boat people in 2004
A full judicial inquiry into the so called ""children overboard"" affair must now be conducted after the
next election, regardless of which party forms government.
Revelations1 on Monday morning confirm the view ... about the manufactured crisis of boat arrivals
since 2001, that the Australian public deserve a full, frank2 and independent judicial inquiry.
Over recent years there have been a succession of inquiries that have revealed disturbing facts
and information about our treatment of boat people and asylum seekers generally.
Since the Tampa incident many Australians have become increasingly concerned with the
government's policies regarding asylum seekers. These policies have and continue to cause
massive and unnecessary trauma.
An inquiry would help ensure that if boats start to come again, we will get our responses right. But
importantly, the critical healing process for the victims of the Government's policies requires that we
uncover the truth about the events of recent years.

A historian's interpretation of the Harvester Judgement and the establishment of the basic wage
Higgins determined that [a fair and reasonable] wage should be sufficient to maintain a man as
'human being in a civilized community'; furthermore ... it must provide for the needs of a family.
He therefore used household budgets to work out the cost of housing, clothing, food, transport,
books ... for a family of five, and declared this a minimum wage for an unskilled male labourer
... the principles of Higgins' Harvester judgement became a fundamental feature of national life.
Wages were to be determined not by bargaining but by an independent arbitrator1. They were
to be based not on profits or productivity but human need. They were premised on the male
breadwinner2, with men's wages sufficient to support a family ... Women contested the dual
standard for the next sixty years.

A historian's interpretation of the developments and achievements of Aboriginal nationalism
Indigenous rights ... had become a powerful force in politicising Aboriginal people and binding
disparate1 groups into a national movement. An Aboriginal flag ... was raised all over the country.
The fight ... emboldened2 Aboriginal people and gave them confidence through a shared sense of
injustice ... [Historian] Russell McGregor has termed this an Aboriginal nationalism.
People across the country marched, occupied sites, formed committees and petitioned parliaments
Appeals were made to the United Nations from 1970 onwards
Aboriginal people forged links with groups overseas, which deepened their justifications for
Indigenous rights and developed emerging ideas of Aboriginal sovereignty ... Indigenous global
networks emerged in the 1970s and ideas were exchanged to improve Indigenous lives worldwide.

A perspective on the oppression experienced by gay and lesbian people in the early 1970s
Homosexuals encounter oppression of three kinds: persecution, discrimination and tolerance
The gayworld1 ... is constantly harassed by police. Homosexuals learn the places to be avoided
because they are commonly visited by the vice squad2
Indeed anyone in a position where he/she is likely to be suspected a homosexual can expect
rough police treatment. I was once stopped and searched ... by two policemen because they saw
me walking with a friend
One can be refused a job, of course, without the real reason being stated ... many men are
refused promotion because they lack a respectable family image ... many women because they
seem ""too masculine""
The most common form of oppression ... tends to be neither outright persecution or discrimination
but rather [a] patronizing3 tolerance ... The difference between tolerance and acceptance is very
considerable, for tolerance is a [gift] extended by the superior to the inferior.

A historian's interpretation of the Curtin government's decision to extend the boundaries in which
Australian conscripts could serve
[In] 1942 the issue which had divided Australia in 1916 and 1917 re-emerged: conscription for
overseas service
There had been calls for conscription for overseas service from very early in [World War II].
1942 the Australian army was made up of two parts - the volunteer A.I.F. (Australian Imperial
Force), who could be sent to fight anywhere; and the conscripted A.M.F. (Australian Military Force1)
which could be compelled2 to serve only on Australian territory. But in 1939 ... the Defence Act had
been amended to include parts of New Guinea ... [In] 1942 Prime Minister Curtin decided that
single army was needed, and that it must be able to be sent beyond New Guinea. To achieve this,
the Defence Act would need to be amended
... [In] January 1943 Curtin was authorised by his party to ... make the appropriate amendment to
the Defence Act

A historical interpretation of Australia's involvement in the war in the Indo-Malayan region
during the 1950s
[The] Malayan Emergency was declared ... in response to the murder of three estate managers

overthrow of the British colonial government
Australian involvement in the Emergency began ... in response to a request from the British
government
Australian ground forces arrived in Malaya in October 1955 to form part of the Australian
contribution to ... deter external communist aggression
Confrontation, or Konfrontasi in Indonesian, was a small undeclared war ... through which
President Sukarno of Indonesia sought to destabilise3 and ultimately destroy the new Federation
of Malaysia
The Australian government was extremely wary of involving its troops in conflict with Indonesia
... [due to the] border that Indonesia shared with Papua New Guinea.

An extract from a letter written to a British merchant in December 1765, signed by Thomas Cushing,
James Otis, Samuel Adams and Thomas Gray, who were members of the Massachusetts Assembly
The Colonists have as great a Regard1 for Right, Liberty and Justice as any People under
Heaven-and they generally have Knowledge enough to discover when their Rights are infringed
They hold themselves intitled2 to all the inherent3, unalienable4 Rights of Nature, as Men-
and to all the essential Rights of Britons, as subjects ... The primary, absolute, natural Rights of
Englishmen as frequently declared in Acts of Parliament from Magna Charta5 to this Day, are
Personal Security, Personal Liberty and Private Property ... It is a fundamental Principle of the
British Constitution that the supreme Power6 cannot take from any Man any Part of his Property
without his Consent in Person or by Representation.

A historical interpretation, published in 2020, of the colonial reaction to the Coercive Acts passed by the
British parliament following the Boston Tea Party
[C]olonists had to await Britain's reaction to the fate of the ships. News of that reaction first arrived
in mid-May [1774], with further details trickling in over the next few months. Americans learned that
Parliament had closed the port of Boston until the tea was paid for, then followed up with a series of
punitive1 laws known as the Coercive Acts.
During the summer of 1774, Americans everywhere discussed the appropriate response to
such parliamentary measures, leading to the convening2 of the (First) Continental Congress in
September. Before adjourning3 in late October, the congressmen adopted resolutions on the
controversy and, more important, called for the creation of a series of local committees to enforce
trade boycott of Great Britain. Throughout the rest of the year, the committees worked to establish
their legitimacy and, in conjunction with newly elected provincial congresses, began to challenge
the authority of the existing colonial governments.

A historical interpretation, published in 2013, outlining the treatment of Loyalists during and after the
War of Independence
[The Treaty of Paris 1783] made no mention of loyal white Americans outside of a meaningless
clause in Article V that required the rebel Congress to ""earnestly recommend"" that each state
legislature ""provide for the restitution1 of all estates, rights, and properties which have been
confiscated belonging to real British subjects""
Throughout the war, colonial governments had enacted laws confiscating the property of prominent
loyalists. Because the states and not the Congress had seized the property, Congress had no
power to deal with the question of loyalist reparations2. It could not enforce the restoration of seized
loyalist property or compel liberal treatment3 of returning loyalists. This meant, as both loyalists and
the victorious rebels understood, that the loyalists would receive no mercy
Anti-loyalist activity went unpunished in local neighborhoods. Angry residents used every
means in their power-intimidation, assault, tarring and feathering-to prevent the exiles from
returning home.

An extract from the pamphlet titled What is the Third Estate?, written by Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès and
published at the beginning of 1789
This document is set out quite simply. We have three questions to ask ourselves.
1.	What is the Third Estate?-everything.
2.	What has it been until now in the political order?-nothing.
3.	What is it asking?-to be something.
Who would thus dare to say that the Third Estate does not contain everything that is needed to
make up a complete nation? ... If the privileged orders were removed, the nation would not be
worse off for it, but better. So, what is the Third [Estate]? Everything, but a fettered1 and oppressed
everything. What would it be without the privileged order? ... Nothing can happen without it;
everything would be infinitely better without the others.

A historical interpretation, published in 2003, outlining some of the events occurring at the
Estates-General, including the Tennis Court Oath in 1789
On the 17th [June] ... the Third [Estate] took the title National Assembly by a vote of 491 to 90
there had been rumours that the Estates would be dismissed and the financial crisis resolved by
new loans ... The lawyers in the Third Estate had become revolutionaries.
Necker finally persuaded Louis XVI to try to take the matter in hand1 by holding a royal session
of all three orders
The bungling2 of the preparations for the royal session only reinforced the National Assembly's
resolution to stand firm ... When the deputies arrived on the morning of the 20th to find placards3
closing the assembly hall ... many immediately concluded that a formal dissolution was imminent4.
Angered at the contempt5 for their rights ... they went to a nearby enclosed tennis court and there
took an oath not to separate from the National Assembly ... until they had established a constitution
for the kingdom. The Tennis Court Oath was one of the great days of the Revolution ... The oath
was a symbol of national unity ... and it reaffirmed the assumption of sovereignty the National
Assembly took on ... the 17th.
Equally important, the oath undermined the King's solution even before it was offered.

A historical interpretation, published in 1975, outlining the new regime's economic challenges in 1793
Revolutionary France had scarcely1 declared war on the monarchies of Europe when ... she was
faced with a foreign coalition and military defeat, with aristocratic counter-revolution and civil war,
with an economic crisis and a popular upsurge2
The financial crisis was made worse by the continual issuing of new assignats3 which led to a rapid
rise in the cost of living
The decline in the value of the currency continued unchecked, made worse by the impact of the
King's execution and by the effects of a European war
As a result of this the food crisis could only grow worse. Wage-earners were paid on average
20 sous4 per day in the country areas and 40 in Paris. In certain areas bread cost as much as
8 sous per pound5, and all other goods ... were undergoing similar price increases. Not only was
bread expensive; it was also scarce.

A historical interpretation, published in 2022, outlining some decisions made by Alexander Kerensky in
the months leading up to October 1917
Kerensky was well aware of the Bolsheviks' preparations, but even they could not shake his
complacency1. He told the British ambassador, Sir George Buchanan, 'I only wish that they
would come out, and I will then put them down.' On 20 October, he boasted ... that he welcomed
Bolshevik revolt, because they would be utterly defeated. The same day the minister for war,
General Aleksandr Verkhovsky, warned Kerensky that the army was incapable of fighting, so the
best policy would be to open negotiations with the Germans and steal the Bolsheviks' thunder2.
Kerensky angrily rejected the idea and sacked3 him
On the basis of faulty information ... the government prepared for an uprising, first on 17 October,
then on 20 October, and once more two days later. 'Rumours are more and more persistently
being spread,' wrote Gorky4 on 18 October, 'that some ""action by the Bolsheviks"" will take place
on 20 October; in other words, the disgusting scenes of 3-5 July may be repeated.' ... Kerensky
preferred to think that the Bolsheviks' nerve would again fail as it had in July.

A historical interpretation, published in 1986, about the purpose of the policy of War Communism
after June 1918
In speech after speech Lenin first urged, then announced, the sending of detachments of
'thousands and thousands' of 'politically advanced' workers from the two capitals to the
countryside, to head the food requisitioning detachments
This attitude to the products of the peasantry is often spoken of as 'War Communism', the
implication being that it was an emergency policy dictated by the exigencies1 of the Civil War. This
is quite untrue. Not only had the Civil War not really started at the time of the original decrees, but
Lenin in June 1918 already defined the grain monopoly2 from a quite different point of view
That is to say, far from being a 'war' measure the 'War Communism' policy was a conscious
attempt to create a new social order, to effect the immediate transformation of the country into
full socialism.

A historical interpretation, published in 2009, of the difficulties implementing the New Life Movement
that was launched in 1934
It soon became clear that individual moral regeneration1 was not going to be embraced by the
inhabitants of a country that desperately needed large-scale political reform. In spite of May-ling's2
statement that the New Life Movement was ""welcomed by our people as water is craved by the
famishing3,"" the Chinese were either too poor to pay attention or too rich to want to change
It was not until the Second World War, when the New Life Movement developed offshoots such as
the Wounded Soldiers League, that it began to make any significant contribution to the country.
Meanwhile, as the American minister, Nelson T. Johnson, noted, ""It is doubtful whether the
personalities interested in the movement are sufficiently pure themselves to give the movement
much prestige.""

This extract is from a political report by Chairman Mao Zedong (Mao Tse-tung) to the Seventh
National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) on 24 April 1945. In his report, he makes
comparison between the strategies of the Guomindang (Kuomintang) forces and the Red Army during
the Sino-Japanese War.
[T]here exist in China two different guiding lines: one of which helps to defeat the Japanese
aggressors, but the other ... in some respects actually helps them to undermine the
anti-Japanese war.
The passive policy adopted by the KMT1 government towards the war with Japan and its
reactionary2 policy of oppression towards the people have resulted in military defeats, the loss of
large parts of territory, a financial and economic crisis, the oppression of the people, hardships in
the people's livelihood, and the undermining of national unity
In the liberated areas [areas taken by the Communists], all anti-Japanese people in labour,
peasant, youth, women's cultural, and other organizations, under the leadership of a democratic
government, are engaging themselves heartily3 in various work to help the army, such as
mobilizing people to join the army, transporting supplies for the troops, giving preferential treatment
to the families of soldiers, and solving material difficulties for the troops.

A historical interpretation, published in 2003, by two economists outlining the directions taken in the
Second Five-Year Plan, also known as the Great Leap Forward
Starting from the summer of 1958, China was to experience in the next few years one of the most
radical revolutionary changes in the history of mankind-the Great Leap Forward ... the Leap was
an unorthodox1 development strategy conceived to hasten the pace of transforming the Chinese
economy from its predominantly agrarian2 nature into a powerful industrial state ... a specific
objective of the Leap was to increase both agricultural and industrial output by manifolds3, the
former by expanding the acreage4 covered by irrigation and the latter via increasing the capacity
of steel and iron production. As China was severely constrained with capital5 and backward
in technology, achieving rapid growth via technical change was an unlikely option. An obvious
alternative, given China's abundant surplus rural workers, was to make greater use of these
resources by mobilizing them to engage in a variety of industrial and public projects through the
restructuring of work and other aspects of social organization
