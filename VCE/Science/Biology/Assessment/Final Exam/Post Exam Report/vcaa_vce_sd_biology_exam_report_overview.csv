Science,Biology,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEBIER,VCEBIERGC,General Comments,,The length of the examination was appropriate and gave students the opportunity to complete the paper in the time available.,,0
Science,Biology,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEBIER,VCEBIERGC,General Comments,,"In Section A, the multiple-choice questions provided students with a variety of question styles, formats, amounts of reading, and levels of difficulty.",,1
Science,Biology,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEBIER,VCEBIERGC,General Comments,,"Students should use the reading time to consider the Section B questions, identify the key information required, and start formulating their answers. Notwithstanding handwriting size, the number of lines under a question gave an indication of the amount of space required to answer it.",,2
Science,Biology,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEBIER,VCEBIERGC,General Comments,,"In Section B, many students produced responses of a high standard and it was clear that they had read the questions carefully and planned their answers prior to writing. Answering in dot points is acceptable and can help students to ensure they are addressing all parts of a question; this was an issue in Question 4c where many students only addressed the second part of the question. Students should use the number of marks as an indication of the level of detail required in their response. For example, Question 4a required students to provide three different reasons for why photosynthesis can be considered a biochemical pathway.",,3
Science,Biology,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEBIER,VCEBIERGC,General Comments,,"When a question asks students to provide an explanation, it is important that they provide extra information to demonstrate their knowledge rather than just repeating information from the question stem. This was a common error in Question 5a.ii, where many students only discussed the environmental benefit of using less nitrogen fertiliser rather than the impact on the plant if more nitrogen was available. Students should familiarise themselves with the VCAA glossary of command terms, such as 'compare', 'justify' and 'outline', to ensure their response specifically addresses the question.",,4
Science,Biology,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEBIER,VCEBIERGC,General Comments,,"Students are advised to incorporate biological knowledge when answering questions; for example, in Question 5a.ii they could do so by connecting chlorophyll to its role in the light-dependent stage of photosynthesis. Students are encouraged to relate their answers to the context of the question, rather than simply repeating pre-planned responses. This was seen in Question 8c.ii, with many students providing a pre-planned speciation response, whereas the question required students to discuss what led to the genetic diversity between two already separate groups/populations.",,5
Science,Biology,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEBIER,VCEBIERGC,General Comments,,"Students should ensure they are familiar with the key science skills, as these were assessed in multiple ways across the examination (such as in Section A Questions 18, 23 and 24, and in Section B Questions 1e, 10c.i and 10c.ii). The use of a ruler (one of the basic stationery items allowed in all exams) would assist students with reading graphs accurately, which was a requirement for Section B Questions 4b, 5a and 10a.",,6
Science,Biology,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEBIER,VCEBIERGC,General Comments,,"The 'extra space for responses' pages at the back of the Question and Answer Book provided students with a designated place to continue their responses if they needed to elaborate further or provide a revised response to their original. On many pages, there was also blank space with no lines under the question, such as after Questions 8c.ii and 9d. Students could use this space instead of, or in addition to, the space at the back. If students chose to use the extra space, they had to clearly indicate this in their response.",,7
