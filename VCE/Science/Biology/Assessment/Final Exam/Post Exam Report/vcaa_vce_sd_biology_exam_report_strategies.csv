Science,Biology,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEBIERB,VCEBI24EQB5,VCEBIERBCM,,Question 5a,ExaminerCommentary,"Students tended to select the chlorophyll option over nitrogen, and this was easier for them to justify using their biological content knowledge. When discussing nitrogen, many students only discussed the environmental benefit of using less nitrogen fertiliser rather than the impact on the plant if more nitrogen was available. Students needed to be aware that nitrogen is a key component of nucleic acid and protein structure.",,64
Science,Biology,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEBIERB,VCEBI24EQB5,VCEBIERBCM,,Question 5a,ExaminerCommentary,Note: 'increasing the efficiency of photosynthesis' or 'improving photosynthesis' is not the same as 'increased photosynthesis'.,,65

Science,Biology,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEBIERB,VCEBI24EQB5,VCEBIERBCM,,Question 5c,ExaminerCommentary,"This is because BstN1 did not cut the DNA of the transformed barley plant, resulting in a larger fragment present in the gel.",,74
Science,Biology,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEBIERB,VCEBI24EQB5,VCEBIERBCM,,Question 5c,ExaminerCommentary,"Students often repeated information provided in the stem to justify their selection of the transformed barley plant (e.g. BstN1 has no recognition sites for DNA from transformed barley plants). Their justification needed to rely on reference to further biological knowledge, rather than simply stating that the banding pattern in Hv1-C did not match the control. Some students incorrectly stated that the larger fragment was due to an inserted gene in the transformed plant. However, the transformation was due to a nucleotide substitution and therefore the DNA from each plant type was the same length before exposure to BstN1.",,75
