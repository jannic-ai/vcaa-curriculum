gene-editing techniques to develop barley plants with an increased ability to take up and
use nitrogen. These new barley varieties will reduce the amount of nitrogen fertiliser used
in crop farming. They will also reduce greenhouse gas emissions because nitrogen from
fertiliser is emitted as nitrous oxide into the environment.
CRISPR-Cas9 technologies are used to edit a gene in the barley seed by causing
single nucleotide substitution. One of the edited genes is Hv7, which alters the amount of
chlorophyll and nitrogen in the transformed barley plant, is shown in the graphs below.

E. salubris is an evergreen tree that reaches up to 25 metres in height. It has small, white
flowers that are thought to be pollinated by insects. It also has seeds that fal directly
beneath the tree canopy.
The researchers sampled 20 populations of E. salubris. They noted differences in the
appearance of the trees and the thickness of the leaves.
The results indicated that the 20 populations could be divided into two distinct groups,
represented in the images below. Image A shows an example of one group, with thicker
leaves, and Image B shows an example of the other group, with thinner leaves.
The two groups live in close geographical proximity but those with thinner leaves are only
found in soils with high phosphorus levels. Genetic analysis comparing the two groups
showed significant differences. These findings strongly indicate that the two groups should
be classified as two separate species.

Arecent study explored variation in the DNA sequences of Indigenous Australians. Genome
DNA sequencing was used to increase understanding of both human genomic diversity and
genetic disease.
Indigenous Australian communities were invited to take part in the genomic research. The research
was conducted in accordance with required ethical guidelines to ensure that the research was
beneficial to the communities and aligned with their own ways of knowing. The collection of
genomic data also falls under Indigenous Australian governance and custodianship.
People from four remote Indigenous communities across northern and central Australia, as well as
non-Indigenous Australians, consented to take part in the research. The four remote Indigenous
communities were: Tiwi Islands, Galiwin'ku, Titjikala and Yarrabah. Their locations are shown on

DNA from 121 Indigenous Australian individuals and 18 non-Indigenous Australian individuals of
European ancestry was sequenced. The sequencing focused on the 0.4% of the human genome
that varies among individuals. In these areas of the genome, 46% of DNA sequence variation was
found within Indigenous individuals in the same community. Only 2.8% of similar DNA sequence
variation was shared across all four remote Indigenous communities.
It was concluded that each community has different and highly diverse DNA sequences. Similarly,
each community is highly diverse in their culture and languages. The study also found that
Indigenous Australians have the highest amount of DNA sequence variation outside Africa, and are
highly genetically distinct from non-Indigenous Australians.
The Tiwi Islands geographically separated from the Australian mainland around 9000 years ago.
However, since at least 26,000 years ago, all communities have been genetically isolated, with
little detectable migration. This is supported by Indigenous Australians' unique knowledges and
connections to Country and Place.

herd immunity in vaccination advertising campaigns influences an individual's vaccination decisions in
Australia. They based their investigation on Scandinavian research that included three dif erent groups:
Group A, Group B and Group C.
The student recruited 121 participants via the school newsletter and social media pages. Participants
were randomly placed into each group.
Individuals within each group received the fol
owing information:
'Imagine that there is a new and infectious disease in the world. The infected people have influenza
symptoms, but usually recover quickly. The virus has caused a few deaths, but scientists have concerns
that the virus will mutate and become more infectious. A vaccine against the virus is available, but it is
not yet fully tested for side effects.'
Groups B and C received additional information as outlined in the table below.
Additional information received
'The vaccine stimulates the body to rapidly respond to the virus, which helps
to prevent iliness. This is an individual benefit of vaccination.'
C 'Due to young age, allergies or poor health, a portion of the population cannot OU
be vaccinated. To prevent iliness in this group, it is important that the majority
of the population get vaccinated. This highlights the benefit of herd immunity
to the population.' _i'

After reading the information, participants were asked to answer the question 'How likely are you to get
vaccinated?' s
Each participant rated the likelihood that they would get vaccinated by choosing one option from the
scale below.
Not likely Slightly likely |Somewhat likely Likely Very likely

Animal brains are made up of specialised cells called neurons. The activity of these cells relies on
constant supply of oxygen. When oxygen supply is too low (hypoxia), brain activity stops.
Scientists often use tadpoles during research. Tadpoles hatch from eggs that are laid in groups of
thousands. Their skin can be transparent, as shown in the diagram below.

During the early stages of their development, tadpoles absorb dissolved oxygen from the water
through their gills.
Researchers conducted an experiment using tadpoles. The experiment was approved by the ethical
standards committee. The tadpoles were used to explore whether photosynthetic cyanobacteria
could serve as an alternative oxygen source to that supplied in the water. Researchers injected
cyanobacteria into the hearts of tadpoles. The cyanobacteria entered each tadpole's bloodstream
and were transported to other parts of the body, including the brain.
After the injection, these tadpoles were placed in a dark, hypoxic environment. After about
65 minutes, brain activity stopped, indicated by the white arrowheads in the figure below. These
tadpoles were then exposed to light. After 15-20 minutes in the light, brain activity restarted,
indicated by the black arrowheads in the figure below.

In the future, this might provide a way to increase oxygen levels to humans during medical
emergencies. However, a major challenge for a future use of injectable photosynthetic
microorganisms is the potential activation of an immune response in people. Much more research
is needed to ensure the safety of this potential treatment.

Use the following information to answer part b below and part c on page 41.
One species of hominins, Homo neanderthalensis, lived in Europe and west Asia
for hundreds of thousands of years before disappearing about 40 000 years ago.
Modern-day non-African Homo sapiens have inherited 1-2% of their DNA from
H. neanderthalensis.
Evidence for interbreeding between H. sapiens and H. neanderthalensis has been
obtained from two recent studies and is summarised in the table below. Each study
analysed the genomes belonging to H. sapiens individuals of different ages.
