Science,Biology,Year 11,Unit 1,VCEBIU1AS2,Area of Study 2 - How do plant and animal systems function?,Outcome 2,VCEBIU1AS2O2KK,DetailedExampleStep,Paragraph,"Most wheat cropping in Australia relies on rainfall because there is no option for irrigation or it is too expensive for larger scale farms. Australian grain growers regularly check weather updates from the Bureau of Meteorology. Farmers need the rain to fall at the right time and in the right place. Unfortunately, due largely to climate change, Australian farming areas are being plagued by periods of low rainfall, hot weather, dry winds and drought. In these conditions, plants can struggle to grow, survive and reproduce.",,,,29
Science,Biology,Year 11,Unit 1,VCEBIU1AS2,Area of Study 2 - How do plant and animal systems function?,Outcome 2,VCEBIU1AS2O2KK,DetailedExampleStep,Paragraph,"Water movement throughout a plant is essential to its ability to grow, survive and reproduce. In a farming system, growers are keen for the plant to use every millimetre of water. From a scientific point of view, they want to offer farmers a variety that has the best adaptive traits possible. The CSIRO (ECOS) has found plants that, with adaptations, are higher yielding under drought conditions and better at maintaining growth. This is reflected in the fact that they keep their stomata open longer when stressed during flowering. Sensitive plants close those stomata quickly under stress and stop growing. Stomata control transpiration of water and photosynthesis and thereby regulate growth and grain production.",,,,30

In ACT, the patient's T cells are removed in a process known as apheresis. The T cells known to fight the particular cancer in the patient are grown in a laboratory and inserted back into the patient's body. Recently there has been the evolution of CAR T cells. CAR stands for chimeric antigen receptors, which is a type of antigen-targeted receptor that has been genetically engineered onto a patient's own T cell. The use of genetic engineering approaches to insert antigen-targeted receptors of defined specificity into T cells has greatly enhanced the potential capabilities of ACT.

In particular, the general guiding principle behind ethical research is to do no harm to participants, including non-human animals, the researcher and community. Teachers should guard against investigation questions that may be inappropriate for secondary school student researchers and be mindful of particular sensitivities within their school community and broader community. In the circumstance that a student is assessed as having designed an investigation that cannot be safely conducted, they may be provided with an alternative method to then generate primary data.
Due to the time available to design, conduct and report the finding of their scientific investigation, students must be practical and realistic when deciding on investigation topics. Teachers should be equally pragmatic when advising students about their choice of investigation topics and when guiding the students in the formulation of the investigation question. Appropriate teacher intervention not only minimises risks but also serves as formative feedback for students.",,,,35
