Science,Biology,Years 11 and 12,,VCEBI12OVSC01,Scope of study,,Paragraph,"The study of Biology explores the diversity of life as it has evolved and changed over time, and considers how living organisms function and interact. It explores the processes of life, from the molecular world of the cell to that of the whole organism, and examines how life forms maintain and ensure their continuity. Students study contemporary research, models and theories to understand how knowledge in biology has developed and how this knowledge continues to change in response to new evidence and discoveries. An understanding of the complexities and diversity of biology provides students with the opportunity to appreciate the interconnectedness of concepts and areas both within biology, and across biology and the other sciences.",,1
Science,Biology,Years 11 and 12,,VCEBI12OVSC02,Scope of study,,Paragraph,"An important feature of undertaking a VCE science study is the opportunity for students to engage in a range of scientific investigation methodologies, to develop key science skills, and to interrogate the links between knowledge, theory and practice. Students work collaboratively as well as independently on a range of scientific investigations involving controlled experiments, fieldwork, case studies, correlational studies, classification and identification, modelling, simulations, literature reviews, and the development of a product, process or system. Knowledge and application of the safety and ethical guidelines associated with biological investigations is integral to the study of VCE Biology.",,2
Science,Biology,Years 11 and 12,,VCEBI12OVSC03,Scope of study,,Paragraph,"As well as increasing their understanding of scientific processes, students develop insights into how knowledge in biology has changed, and continues to change, in response to new evidence, discoveries and thinking. They develop capacities that enable them to critically assess the strengths and limitations of science, respect evidence-based conclusions and gain an awareness of the ethical contexts of scientific endeavours. Students consider how science is connected to innovation in addressing contemporary biological challenges.",,3
Science,Biology,Years 11 and 12,,VCEBI12OVRA01,Rationale,,Paragraph,"VCE Biology enables students to investigate the processes involved in sustaining life at cellular, system and species levels. In undertaking this study, students develop an understanding that, in the dynamic and interconnected system of life, all change has consequences that may affect an individual, a species or the collective biodiversity of Earth. Students gain insights into how molecular and evolutionary concepts and key science skills underpin much of contemporary biology, and how society applies such skills and concepts to resolve problems and make scientific advancements.",,1
Science,Biology,Years 11 and 12,,VCEBI12OVRA02,Rationale,,Paragraph,"In VCE Biology, students develop and enhance a range of inquiry skills including practical experimentation, research and analytical skills, problem-solving skills including critical and creative thinking, and communication skills. Students pose questions, formulate hypotheses, conduct investigations, and analyse and critically interpret qualitative and quantitative data. They assess
the limitations of data, evaluate methodologies and results, justify their conclusions, make recommendations and communicate their findings. Students use biological knowledge, scientific skills and ethical understanding to investigate and analyse contemporary bioethical issues and communicate their views from an informed position.",,2
Science,Biology,Years 11 and 12,,VCEBI12OVRA03,Rationale,,Paragraph,"VCE Biology provides for continuing study pathways within the discipline and can lead to a range of careers. Branches of biology include botany, genetics, immunology, microbiology, pharmacology and zoology. In addition, biology is applied in many fields of human endeavour including bioethics, biotechnology, dentistry, ecology, education, food science, forestry, health care, horticulture, medicine, optometry, physiotherapy and veterinary science. Biologists work in cross-disciplinary areas such as bushfire research, environmental management and conservation, forensic science, geology, medical research and sports science.",,3
