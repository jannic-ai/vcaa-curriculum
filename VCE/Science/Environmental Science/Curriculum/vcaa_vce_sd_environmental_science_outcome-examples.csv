Take four microscope slides and label N, S, W and E; use masking tape to attach the slides on each of the four sides of the stake, leaving about three-quarters of the slide exposed to the air and orienting the slide labelled 'N' to the north, the slide labelled 'S' to the south, and so on. Smear each slide with Vaseline and leave the stake in place for a week, if possible (stake will need to be protected if rain is predicted). At the end of the experiment, take the slides off the stake, being careful not to smudge the Vaseline, and take them to school (e.g. taped to the bottom of the inside of a lidded plastic container). Examine each slide under a microscope to identify the particles (pollen, dust, fly ash, diesel carbon and grit - use identification guides) and the number (e.g. use a Likert scale such as 'absent', 'rare', 'uncommon', 'common' and 'abundant'). Tabulate results and then analyse them by asking students to respond to questions such as, 'Which direction has the most particles?' (prevailing winds); 'Which particles are most common?' (pollen = rural; diesel carbon = roads); 'Are particles equally common in all directions?' (maybe a shed is on one side?); 'Which of these particles would cause the most impact to the environment?' (dust covering plants affects photosynthesis); 'Which of these particles would cause the most impact to humans?' (diesel carbon may affect respiratory passages).
