the 1850s. Mining declined significantly by the 1920s but still continues in the wider region
today. The waste from processes used to extract gold from the mined rock are called mine
tailings. Tailings can contain high concentrations of harmful heavy metals such as arsenic,
lead and mercury. Mine tailings are now regulated as part of any mining development
licence; however, in the early mining period these legal protections did not exist.
This public reserve is currently used by local residents. Preliminary investigation of the
site identified 110 flora species (41% were indigenous plants and 59% were exotic) and
49 different fauna species. Some significant remnant habitat trees exist within the reserve
and one rare local plant species was found (although these were planted by the local
Landcare group).
Amining company proposes to excavate, from this creek valley reserve, 3.5 million tonnes
of tailings material that covers the natural ground surface. This material will be processed
to recover gold, mercury and industrial sand.
The plan is for vegetation to be cleared from the reserve and the tailings removed
(between one to two metres in depth). The material will be moved to a nearby processing
area and storage facility on private land. The proposal aims to then progressively restore
the original landscape, the indigenous ecology, and cultural and hydrological values of the
creek valley over a five-year period.
Before the proposal can proceed, the Minister for Planning has decided that an
environmental effects statement (EES) must be prepared for consideration. An EES wil
analyse the potential effects of the project on the environment and the means of avoiding,
minimising or managing possible adverse effects.",,21

challenge for urban areas. Rising temperatures particularly affect cities because of the
'urban heat island effect', in which urban areas are warmer than the surrounding rural land.
This is a result of the presence of roads, pathways, buildings and dark roofs that absorb
heat more than green (e.g. gardens and parks) and blue (e.g. rivers and lakes) surfaces.
With the urban heat island effect, temperatures in our urban areas can be 1-7 °C higher

Use the following information to answer parts d and e.
An open-cut coal mine was closed in 2012 and has since undergone rehabilitation.
The following measures were taken:
Topsoil was spread across the area; physical erosion-control measures were
implemented; tree hollows, woody debris and logs were incorporated into the landscape;
and nesting boxes were installed.
- Native seeds were sown and more sensitive plants were transplanted as tube-stock trees.
Revegetation with native flora was monitored and invasive weeds were removed to
ensure the success of the rehabilitation process.
The main hole created by the mine was allowed to fill with rainwater and run-off. It will
eventually flow into the nearby creek.

Bendigo Creek, where it was formerly locally extinct. This fish grows 6-8 cm in length and
occupies wetland habitat, using dense reeds and driftwood for protection from predators
and for breeding. These fish play a vital role in the Bendigo Creek ecosystem. They
consume mosquito larvae, providing a natural method of pest control. They also act as
key food source for numerous native freshwater fish and waterbird species.
Local extinction of the Bendigo Creek perch population occurred during the mid-19th
century. This was due to habitat loss and degradation, competition from invasive fish
species, prolonged drought and excessive water extraction for agriculture.
Following the reintroduction of the southern pygmy perch in 2020, populations of this fish
are now thriving in Bendigo Creek.

Science,Environmental Science,,,Year 12,Final Exam,Exam Questions,2025,,VCEES25ERB,VCEES25EQB3,B,Section B,3,Q3,13,Question,"Ten years ago, a farming family bought an 8 hectare section of a former cattle property and
converted it into an organic market garden. Their aim was to produce mainly herbs and
vegetables, as well as native fruits and seeds.
This family now supplies produce to three local markets and several restaurants within
a 10 km radius of the farm. The prices of their organic herbs, vegetables and fruits are
higher than the prices for produce grown using conventional methods. However, the local
community has supported the organic market garden because of its interest in native foods
and the belief that the use of chemicals in food production can be harmful to health.
A creek runs along the northern boundary of the market garden. The land for the cattle
property was cleared more than 150 years ago and, over time, this led to poor soil quality,
erosion of the creek banks and a build-up of sediment in the creek. The productivity of the
cattle farm declined. The farming family has worked with local environmental groups to
revegetate the creek valley with endemic plants.
As organic farmers, the family has used a variety of natural methods to improve soil health,
for example:
•	 using naturally occurring fertilisers such as green compost and animal manures (rather
than industrially manufactured fertilisers)
•	 minimising water use to irrigate the plants
•	 implementing biological pest control methods (rather than using chemical pesticides)
•	 planting legumes, which add nitrogen to the soil.",,18

The purpose of the KCG station is to take many individual measurements of key indicators of global air
quality, such as greenhouse gases and ozone-depleting substances. The KCG station's unique location
allows for local sources of pollution to be avoided by only taking measurements at times when winds
blow in from across the Southern Ocean. Avoiding local pollution in this way allows for changes in global
air quality to be measured over time.

Science,Environmental Science,,,Year 12,Final Exam,Exam Questions,2025,,VCEES25ERB,VCEES25EQB5,B,Section B,5,Q5,8,Question,"Cotton is one of Australia's most valuable exports, with 90% of cotton grown in Australia
being sold overseas. Cotton is an annual crop, with the planting season usually beginning
in September and harvesting in autumn. The flower of the cotton plant is harvested to
produce fibres for clothing and other textiles.
Source: zcebeci/Shutterstock.com
Cotton has an optimal growing temperature of 28 °C ± 2 °C. Temperatures below 11
can negatively affect seedling growth. In addition, extreme high temperatures can cause
flower loss, reducing crop yield.
Climate scientists are investigating the potential opportunities and risks of climate
change for cotton farmers. In 2024, historical climate modelling found that between 1960
and 2020 there was:
•	 a decrease in the average number of early season cold shocks
•	 a decrease in days from planting until first flowering
•	 an increase in average growing season temperatures
•	 an increase in the frequency of high-temperature days
•	 an increase in evaporation and transpiration rates
•	 no significant change in seasonal rainfall.

keeping it warmer in winter and cooler in summer. Insulation materials are given an R value, which is
measure of the rate of heat loss or gain. The higher the R value, the better the material insulates.
A class of students wanted to compare five insulation materials. They were provided with R values from
manufacturers. They obtained five identical boxes made of plywood with tightly fitting, removable lids.
They attached pieces of insulation of equal thickness to the sides and bottoms of each box, including
the lid, but left one box without any insulation coverage.
The following table provides information about the different insulation materials that were used by the
