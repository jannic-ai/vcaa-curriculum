Science,Environmental Science,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEESERB,VCEES24EQB1,VCEESERBLR,LimitedStrategies,Question 1f,ExaminerCommentary,"Overall, this question was not well answered by many students. There was a lack of understanding of the term 'validity' and many of the lower-scoring responses jumbled the concepts of accuracy, reliability and validity. Correct responses acknowledged that validity relates to the ability of an experiment to test or measure what it set out to. Because the CO2 traps are less effective in trapping smaller insects, this would not show the diversity of all insects (the researchers would only trap larger insects) and would therefore not be a valid study. It originally set out to test the numbers of all insects and because of this limitation would be less valid.",,32
Science,Environmental Science,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEESERB,VCEES24EQB1,VCEESERBER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 1g,ExaminerCommentary,"Given the information provided on how insect diversity data was collected, to provide a complete response, students needed to clearly evaluate whether or not this study adhered to ethical guidelines and develop their reasoning. Higher-scoring responses focused on explaining that for research to be considered ethical, the collection of insects should minimise the harm and suffering of the organisms, the insects should not be killed, and scientists should only trap the minimal numbers needed. Based on this, some students presented reasoning that the study was ethical because the insects were released after they had recovered from the anaesthetic and were not killed, the anaesthetic did not stress the insects, and they were collected across the site using grid sampling so only minimal numbers were caught to give population figures. Other students argued that the research was not ethical because the trapping would cause some harm to the insects, they would suffer (or may even die) when being held in a trap, or that there was no evidence that minimal numbers were targeted during the research. Both approaches demonstrated an understanding of ethical principles in scientific fieldwork and research. Some students tried to use the term 'non-maleficence' in their response without making it clear what this principle meant in the context of this research.",,33
Science,Environmental Science,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEESERB,VCEES24EQB2,VCEESERBCM,,Question 2a,ExaminerCommentary,"Information was provided about the behaviour and distribution of Australian sea lions, including a map showing their current and historical range. The map indicated that this species is endemic to the southern half of Australia, a fact that not many students recognised. The key idea that most students gave was that because there has been a significant reduction in the sea lions' range (they no longer exist in Victorian and Tasmanian waters), this would contribute to their classification as endangered. Incorrect responses did not focus on the part of the question about 'how the range of the sea lion ... contributed to this classification' and discussed general points about decreasing population size, over-hunting by Europeans or simply gave a definition of 'endangered'.",,34
Science,Environmental Science,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEESERB,VCEES24EQB2,VCEESERBCM,,Question 2b,ExaminerCommentary,An understanding of the IUCN classification system meant that suitable responses recognised that management teams would be aiming to have the classification changed to 'vulnerable'. Better student responses explained this by commenting that 'vulnerable' indicates an improvement in population numbers and therefore the sea lion numbers would have increased and would be at a lower risk of extinction. Incorrect responses tried to argue that having the classification changed to 'critically endangered' would be the management team's aim because it would equate to greater protection for the species. It is a false argument to aim to let the population size decrease to a more critical stage (i.e. closer to extinction) and then begin to do something about trying to save the sea lion species.,,35
Science,Environmental Science,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEESERB,VCEES24EQB2,VCEESERBCM,,Question 2c,ExaminerCommentary,"Most students understood the connection between small population numbers and a decrease in genetic diversity. Better responses then went on to explain that a lack of genetic diversity would mean the sea lion population is less likely to have a natural resistance to a new disease. With less resistance, more sea lions could die, thereby further reducing already small numbers.",,36
Science,Environmental Science,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEESERB,VCEES24EQB2,VCEESERBCM,,Question 2c,ExaminerCommentary,"Incorrect responses tried to use an explanation based on the idea that the sea lions, with a reduced range, would all be breeding in the one area and any new disease would quickly spread through the population. It should be understood from the information that there are still 66 breeding colonies that are found from the north of Perth in Western Australia through to the east of Adelaide in South Australia (a lengthy coastline of around 10 000 kilometres).",,37
Science,Environmental Science,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEESERB,VCEES24EQB2,VCEESERBCM,,Question 2d,ExaminerCommentary,"The question asked for students to circle one of the two listed threats to the sea lion population and then explain a management strategy to address this particular threat. In relation to the threat of 'over-exploitation of prey', better responses explained how placing restrictions on the harvest of fish and shellfish (especially on commercial fishing) would allow for an increase in the food supply. Students who circled 'reduction in land-based habitat due to erosion' identified strategies such as:",,38

Incorrect responses discussed the use of captive breeding, which might increase population numbers but would not address either of the two given threats. Other lower-scoring responses misread the threat 'over-exploitation of prey' and wrote answers related to 'by prey'. They incorrectly discussed issues about sea lion numbers declining because they were being eaten by predators as prey.",,42

Science,Environmental Science,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEESERB,VCEES24EQB2,VCEESERBLR,LimitedStrategies,Question 2e,ExaminerCommentary,"Many students failed to understand that the key limitation impacting on the scientists' ability to draw a conclusion was that the study did not assess whether there was a link between PFAS levels and the pups' deaths. It could not be concluded there was a cause-and-effect relationship between the levels and the deaths, and there could be other reasons for the deaths. Appropriate further testing would be required to draw a conclusion regarding the decline in sea lion numbers.",,47

Science,Environmental Science,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEESERB,VCEES24EQB2,VCEESERBLR,LimitedStrategies,Question 2f,ExaminerCommentary,"Lower-scoring responses directly rewrote points from the stem, such as stating that the sea lions should be protected because 'the Wirangu are the traditional custodians' and 'they are their spiritual totem'.",,52
Science,Environmental Science,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEESERB,VCEES24EQB3,VCEESERBCM,,Question 3,ExaminerCommentary,"This question is based on an environmental science case study, a proposal to mine a public reserve for tailings left behind after gold mining last century, with the aim of then restoring the site to a better state. This type of question aims to allow students to apply their knowledge and understanding of environmental management and sustainability principles (as outlined in Unit 3, Area of Study 2).",,53
Science,Environmental Science,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEESERB,VCEES24EQB3,VCEESERBCM,,Question 3a,ExaminerCommentary,"Better responses to this question clearly explained both of the required sustainability principles in the context of the proposal. 'In context' refers to not just providing a basic definition but explaining how it applies to the case study. In this scenario, 'efficiency of resource use' refers to extracting useful resources (i.e. gold, mercury, sand) from the tailings material that is otherwise regarded as waste, while trying to minimise the negative impacts on the creek valley. This type of explanation clearly demonstrates an understanding of the principle rather than just stating 'It is the practice of using resources in a way that maximises output while minimising waste and not impacting negatively on the environment'. Similarly, the principle of 'conservation of biodiversity and ecological integrity' was well demonstrated when students wrote about how the proposal aimed to try to restore the previous ecosystems and improve on the current ecological state. Better responses acknowledged that the current environmental health was very poor (e.g. 59% exotic vegetation, 1-2 metres of tailings covering the original creek valley, toxic heavy metal tailings) and that a restoration plan would help to improve the ongoing ecological integrity of the public reserve.",,54
Science,Environmental Science,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEESERB,VCEES24EQB3,VCEESERBER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 3a,ExaminerCommentary,"Many students did not take note of the two command terms used in the question: 'evaluate' and 'justify'. As part of preparing for any VCE examination, students should have a clear understanding of what different command terms mean and how each should be addressed. Definitions of command terms are published on the VCAA website. Higher-scoring responses were able to justify that the proposal would meet the nominated sustainability principles because the restoration was based on the already highly disturbed and degraded state of the creek valley, the amount of weed species and issues around toxic heavy metals. Many students acknowledged that there would be some initial disturbance but over the five-year plan, the public reserve would eventually be in a much better ecological state and the community would benefit from resources that would otherwise be regarded as waste. The integrity of the site has been destroyed by previous mining activities; therefore, a plan to restore it and remove introduced species is an effort to positively address sustainability issues.",,55

Many responses gave an incorrect interpretation of the precautionary principle, confusing it with conducting a risk assessment or a cost-benefit analysis. Other lower-scoring responses stated that the principle required the proponents to be 'cautious' or just stop any negative environmental impacts. Higher-scoring students clearly understood that the precautionary principle refers to a lack of certainty around potential harmful environmental impacts (due to insufficient scientific information) and therefore means the proposal should not go ahead until more data is collected and potential impacts are determined. The question asked how the principle should be applied to any proposal to mine the tailings. In this case, there was a lack of evidence to establish the risk levels of extracting tailings and any potential impacts from this, and therefore more scientific research was required. Before the proposal could proceed, the mining company should be required to provide evidence that the environmental damage caused by removing material would be minimal and present plans for how the environment would be returned to its original state.",,65
Science,Environmental Science,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEESERB,VCEES24EQB3,VCEESERBLR,LimitedStrategies,Question 3e,ExaminerCommentary,Most students were able to identify one beneficial and one harmful effect of the proposal. Beneficial impacts on the lithosphere included reshaping the creek valley to its original landscape or removing toxic heavy metal chemicals from the soil. The most commonly stated harmful impact on the hydrosphere was that harmful heavy metals could be released from the soil when disturbed and enter the creek waters via the run-off. Less successful responses made comments about harm or benefits on flora and fauna (rather than soil or water).,,66
Science,Environmental Science,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEESERB,VCEES24EQB4,VCEESERBCM,,Question 4a,ExaminerCommentary,"Students were asked to explain the meaning of the term 'albedo effect' and most responses explained the basic concept that it is a measure of how much solar radiation a surface reflects (or absorbs). Others stated that it is the fraction of solar energy reflected from Earth back into space measured on a scale from zero (absorbs all radiation) to 1 (reflects all radiation). Better responses went on to explain that this relates to the urban heat island effect because the darker-coloured surfaces found in cities absorb more radiation (or reflect less radiation) than lighter surfaces. Since urban environments have more dark surfaces (such as buildings, roads and carparks) compared with the surrounding rural areas, this leads to a greater localised warming, which is the urban heat island effect.",,67
Science,Environmental Science,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEESERB,VCEES24EQB4,VCEESERBLR,LimitedStrategies,Question 4b,ExaminerCommentary,"This question required a correct understanding of what the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) confidence rating scale involves. Better responses stated that the confidence rating refers to 'how plausible or likely or probable' the projected range of climate change is for a given emission scenario. They then went on to explain that a particular confidence level is based on the evidence (which could be the type, amount or consistency of the data), the quality of the computer climate models or the degree of scientific agreement that the projection will produce. Many lower-scoring responses confused confidence with the idea of how 'accurate or valid' the projection was or simply stated 'how confident the IPCC are of their prediction'.",,68
Science,Environmental Science,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEESERB,VCEES24EQB4,VCEESERBLR,LimitedStrategies,Question 4c,ExaminerCommentary,Better answers responded to the question of why green roofs and vertical gardens would be classified as a new technology by explaining that this method is using previously unused or recently developed building methods and designs to have an impact (reduction) on atmospheric greenhouse gas levels. Less successful responses did not specifically indicate how greenhouse gas levels would be impacted but rather focused on the effect of this new technology on climate change in general. Better responses made it clear that the plants (in the vertical gardens and green roofs) would absorb carbon dioxide when photosynthesising and therefore could assist with carbon sequestration in a localised environment. This would reduce the levels of this key greenhouse gas (carbon dioxide) in the atmosphere.,,69
Science,Environmental Science,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEESERB,VCEES24EQB4,VCEESERBCM,,Question 4d,ExaminerCommentary,"Many students did not have a clear idea of the difference between mitigation and adaptation strategies used in an effort to manage climate change, and overall this question was not well answered. Better responses explained that mitigation strategies are focused on making the impacts of climate change less severe by reducing or preventing greenhouse gas emissions, and that adaptation strategies involve taking actions to prevent or manage the damage greenhouse gas emissions cause by adjusting to the effects of climate change.

Students were asked to describe a relevant action for each strategy that could have been taken before the successful reintroduction of the perch took place. 'Restoration of habitat' refers to restoring the function of the habitat back to its original, undegraded state. High-scoring responses stated this and then went on to describe how this could be done. Many students identified that replanting dense reed beds and replacing driftwood pieces, as well as restoring water flows, would achieve this. In describing actions related to 'captive breeding', responses needed to make this concept clear by stating that this strategy should take place in a safe, controlled environment, free from competition with the managed mating of genetically diverse perch (usually from different populations) to improve both total numbers and the genetic diversity of the species. Not all students were able to give some relevant description to both of the strategies (especially a clear idea of what captive breeding involves).",,16

They went on to describe why this was the case by discussing how the 'efficiency of resource use' was a focus by using the land and water resources sustainably and minimising negative environmental impacts on the soil, creek and local biodiversity. By reducing the use of chemicals and using compost and manures the farm is using fewer resources to create more value, while producing less waste. The 'intergenerational equity' principle was related to the change in land-use of farming methods that increased biodiversity, stream health, soil nutrient levels and quality, which provided suitable resources for the current generation but also meant that the present generation should pass these natural resources with sufficient environmental quality on to future generations.",,22

Justification of the change from cattle farming to organic market gardening could have included that the cattle farming was not sustainable (that the land was very degraded and that this degradation would continue if there was no change in management practices) so the change to organic market gardening was important because the farm now meets the needs of the present generation (by producing organic foods for consumers) without compromising the needs of future generations. By recycling resources (compost and manures), limiting soil erosion, using minimal water for irrigation and increasing biodiversity, the land would be in an improved state and was therefore a more efficient use of resources.",,23

Economic costs listed included the costs involved in buying and replanting endemic plants, the increased price of organic herbs and vegetables to consumers and the expense of methods to improve soil and biologically control pests. Economic benefits stated were the income gained by the family from the sale of organic produce, the employment opportunities in the local community and the reduced costs by not purchasing chemicals. Many students found it difficult to correctly identify an environmental cost involved in changing from the cattle farm to market gardening. High-scoring responses identified that because the cattle grazing land was converted into organic farming land that an environmental cost could be the chance to restore the whole area to its former natural ecosystem. Other students correctly identified another cost as the loss of native habitat because the reduced yield from organic farming requires more land to be turned over to market gardening to produce enough food to be profitable and to meet the needs of consumers.",,26

Science,Environmental Science,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEESERB,VCEES25EQB7,VCEESERBCM,,Question 7c,ExaminerCommentary,"The major factor that should be considered when evaluating nuclear power against wind generation had to be the safe disposal of the radioactive nuclear waste and/or the possible release of harmful radiation into the environment from a nuclear reactor meltdown. Not many students understood this danger or could not explain this factor clearly. Many students gave answers that related to factors already considered in parts a., b. and ci, such as comparing the renewability or the reliability of wind and nuclear, when the question clearly stated that these factors should not be considered.",,73
Science,Environmental Science,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEESERB,VCEES25EQB8,VCEESERBER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 8a,ExaminerCommentary,"The question asked for a suitable hypothesis to be stated for the experiment that was outlined in the stem. A hypothesis is a clear statement (usually a prediction) that indicates a relationship between an independent and dependent variable (one that can be tested). Higher-scoring responses predicted that the box insulated with the highest R value material (or box 3 covered by natural wool batts) will retain higher levels of heat over the 30-minute period. Other correct answers wrote that the box insulated with the lowest R value material would lose the most heat over the 30 minutes of testing. Some incorrect answers discussed factors such as the water temperature increasing over time, or that the students were trying to measure and calculate R values.",,74
Science,Environmental Science,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEESERB,VCEES25EQB8,VCEESERBCM,,Question 8b,ExaminerCommentary,"The dependent variable that most students correctly identified is the loss of heat (or change in temperature) from the water in the beaker. To be awarded the mark, students needed to be clear that it was the water temperature that was being measured (not the temperature of the box or the air). The most common incorrect answer given was the R value of the insulation (which is the independent variable in the experiment).",,75
Science,Environmental Science,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEESERB,VCEES25EQB8,VCEESERBCM,,Question 8c,ExaminerCommentary,"Most students predicted that box 1 (plain plywood) would lose the highest amount of heat over the 30 minutes and justified this choice by identifying that this box had the lowest R value, which meant that it would lose heat faster (or that the other boxes had insulation with a higher R value would therefore retain heat for longer).",,76
Science,Environmental Science,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEESERB,VCEES25EQB8,VCEESERBCM,,Question 8d,ExaminerCommentary,"This question required students to have a correct understanding of what a systematic error is (as opposed to a random or personal error). Many students jumbled these error terms together and described any experimental errors rather than a systematic one. Systematic errors affect the accuracy of a measurement. Systematic errors cause readings to differ from the true value by a consistent amount each time a measurement is made, so that all the readings are shifted in one direction from the true value (as defined in the study design). The accuracy of measurements subject to systematic errors cannot be improved by simply repeating those measurements.",,77
Science,Environmental Science,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEESERB,VCEES25EQB8,VCEESERBER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 8d,ExaminerCommentary,"A systematic error associated with using the temperature probe would be an error that causes measurements to consistently deviate from the true value in the same direction. This could be due to faulty equipment (e.g. badly constructed box) or the incorrect calibration of the probe (which many students identified). Higher-scoring responses then suggested how this error could have been prevented, for example by checking each probe to ensure that it is not faulty and/or calibrating it against a known, accurately calibrated temperature probe.",,78
Science,Environmental Science,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEESERB,VCEES25EQB8,VCEESERBCM,,Question 8e,ExaminerCommentary,"Most students explained that insulation with a higher R value would help to maintain a more even temperature throughout the home (for both heating and cooling) because less heat from the outside could enter during summer, and less heat could escape from inside the house during winter. This consistently decreases energy demands by the householder (reducing personal energy consumption because people did not have to use their heaters or air conditioners as much).",,79
Science,Environmental Science,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEESERB,VCEES25EQB8,VCEESERBER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 8f,ExaminerCommentary,"A variety of ideas were suggested to explain how the builder could maximise the insulation efficiency of the home in terms of heating and cooling, with the most common being that the builder should use insulation with the highest R value possible to maintain temperatures within the house. Higher-scoring responses then went on to suggest other key ideas to improve the efficiency of the house such as using underfloor insulation (as well as roof and wall) or double-glazed windows. Some students suggested ideas related to the albedo effect (e.g. the choice of lighter paint colours to reflect heat and keep the home cooler).",,80
