Science,Environmental Science,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEESER,VCEESERGC,General Comments,,"The 2024 VCE Environmental Science examination provided students with the opportunity to use their knowledge and understanding of the core concepts from both Units 3 and 4. It was evident that most students were able to use the two hours available to apply their learning. Some students did not finish the paper in the allotted time. Time management is a skill that needs to be developed during revision and preparation for the exam, including making full use of the 15 minutes of reading time to start planning responses.",,0
Science,Environmental Science,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEESER,VCEESERGC,General Comments,,"Student responses varied in their clarity and precision. Higher-scoring responses had clear, well-structured explanations and ideas that were supported, when required, with data or the correct use of key terms from the study design. Knowledge of all key terms, including those used in relation to data and measurement, was required throughout this exam. As well as being able to correctly define key terminology, higher-scoring students were able to use these terms in relation to the scenario being presented and in the context of the question being asked. Lower-scoring responses did not demonstrate an accurate understanding of the required term and/or did not apply it clearly to the example being discussed.",,1
Science,Environmental Science,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEESER,VCEESERGC,General Comments,,"Important exam skills to practise include reading all the information provided, interpreting data in tables or graphs (including the axis, key and title), and directly answering each specific question. Students should not rewrite the question or pieces directly from the stem as their response. It was evident that some students had revised by using past exam papers, which is a key method in preparing well for any examination. However, it is important that students carefully read the actual exam question and all the information provided in the stem and directly respond to that question. Lower-scoring responses attempted to rewrite ideas from past exam questions, which did not apply to the questions or scenarios presented this year.",,2
Science,Environmental Science,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEESER,VCEESERGC,General Comments,,"Students would benefit from practising writing responses to past exam questions where they make their key points clearly and do not contradict themselves. This would also help in understanding and responding to the different command terms used in exam questions, such as 'state', 'explain', 'evaluate' and 'justify'.",,3
Science,Environmental Science,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEESER,VCEESERGC,General Comments,,"As Environmental Science is a VCE science subject, students are expected to be able to apply basic mathematical skills to data. This can include calculating the percentage change in data, energy efficiency ratios, mark-recapture figures and Simpson's Index of Diversity. It is important, as scientists, that students provide units of measurement in their answers (this is an important numeracy skill). For example, in Section B, Question 8, when discussing the use of wind turbines and patterns in the wind speed data, many students did not refer to metres per second or kilowatt hours in their responses.",,4
