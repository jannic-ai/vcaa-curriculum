20. 2-amino acids (a=amino acids)
The table below provides simplified structures for amino acids. These amino acids may
all be classified as '2-amino acids' since the amino group (-NH,) is attached to the second
carbon atom in the carbon chain, numbered from the carboxyl (-COOH) end. They may
also be classified as 'a-amino acids', since both the amino group and the carboxyl group
are attached to the same carbon atom, known as the alpha carbon. These structures
may be used as the basis for drawing zwitterions, identifying the products of protein
hydrolysis and drawing the structures formed in the condensation polymerisation of amino
acid monomers.

ii. Green chemistry principles
The following seven green chemistry principles are relevant to VCE Chemistry:
Atom economy: Processes/pathways should be designed to maximise incorporation of all
reactant materials used in the process into the final product.
- Catalysis: Catalysts should be selected to generate the same desired product(s) with less
waste and using less energy and reagents in reaction processes/pathways.
Design for degradation: Chemical products should be designed so that at the end of their use
they break down into harmless degradation products and do not persist in the environment.
Design for energy efficiency: Processes/pathways should be designed for maximum energy
efficiency and with minimal negative environmental and economic impacts.
Designing safer chemicals: Chemical products should be designed to achieve their intended
function while minimising toxicity.
Prevention of wastes: It is better to prevent waste than to treat or clean up waste after it has
been produced.
Use of renewable feedstocks: Raw materials or feedstocks should be made from renewable
(mainly plant-based) materials, rather than from fossil fuels, whenever practicable.

made worldwide and steel production was responsible for 8% of global carbon dioxide, CO2, emissions.
In traditional steelmaking, iron ore, which is primarily iron(III) oxide, Fe2O3, is reduced with a form
C, known as coke. This occurs in a blast furnace with temperatures between 2200
and 2300 °C, producing molten iron, Fe, and forming CO2 as a by-product.
One alternative process being considered is molten oxide electrolysis (MOE). In MOE, Fe2O3 is heated
to approximately 1600 °C and dissolved in a liquid oxide electrolyte such as calcium oxide, CaO. Fe is
formed at the cathode and oxygen gas, O2(g), is formed at the inert anode. The inert anode needs to be
highly stable and corrosion resistant. Materials being considered for the anode include:
•	 platinum,
•	 iridium,
•	 ceramic-metal oxides.

Heats of combustion of selected blended fuels
Blended fuels are mixtures of compounds with different mixture ratios and, hence,
determination of a generic molar enthalpy of combustion is not realistic. The values
provided in the following table are typical values for heats of combustion at SLC
(25 °C and 100 kPa) with combustion products being CO2(g) and H2O(l). Values for heats
of combustion will vary due to the composition of the different fuels. Additionally, for natural
gas, the values may vary based on the source and processing.

Heats of combustion of selected biofuels
The following table provides typical values for the heat of combustion of selected biofuels.
The values may vary significantly, particularly for biogas, depending on the source of
the biofuel and, hence, its composition. The amount of energy consumed during any
purification process must also be considered when determining the net energy obtained
from a biofuel.

2‑amino acids (α‑amino acids)
The table below provides simplified structures for amino acids. These amino acids may
all be classified as '2-amino acids' since the amino group (-NH2) is attached to the second
carbon atom in the carbon chain, numbered from the carboxyl (-COOH) end. They may
also be classified as 'α-amino acids', since both the amino group and the carboxyl group
are attached to the same carbon atom, known as the alpha carbon. These structures
may be used as the basis for drawing zwitterions, identifying the products of protein
hydrolysis and drawing the structures formed in the condensation polymerisation of amino
acid monomers.

ii. Green chemistry principles
The following seven green chemistry principles are relevant to VCE Chemistry:
Atom economy: Processes/pathways should be designed to maximise incorporation of all
reactant materials used in the process into the final product.
Catalysis: Catalysts should be selected to generate the same desired product(s) with less
waste and using less energy and reagents in reaction processes/pathways.
Design for degradation: Chemical products should be designed so that at the end of their use
they break down into harmless degradation products and do not persist in the environment.
Design for energy efficiency: Processes/pathways should be designed for maximum energy
efficiency and with minimal negative environmental and economic impacts.
Designing safer chemicals: Chemical products should be designed to achieve their intended
function while minimising toxicity.
Prevention of wastes: It is better to prevent waste than to treat or clean up waste after it has
been produced.
Use of renewable feedstocks: Raw materials or feedstocks should be made from renewable
(mainly plant‑based) materials, rather than from fossil fuels, whenever practicable.
