Science,Chemistry,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCECHER,VCECHERGC,General Comments,,"Overall, the examination included a good representative coverage of Units 3 and 4 content. This allowed students to demonstrate their understanding of key knowledge points and their application of key science skills. The new VCE Chemistry Study Design included new content, which, not surprisingly, was challenging for many students.",,0
Science,Chemistry,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCECHER,VCECHERGC,General Comments,,Key points for consideration relating to this new material are outlined below.,,1
Science,Chemistry,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCECHER,VCECHERGC,General Comments,,"Melting point and how it can be used to both identify a compound and its relative purity were addressed in Question 1a. The most common student misconception was that the difference in melting point of an unknown sample from that of a pure sample was solely due to the level of impurity. This cannot always be assumed to be true. For example, a product is isolated during the process of synthesising salicylic acid from benzoic acid. If this product has a melting point of 122 °C, and salicylic acid has a known melting point of 158.6 °C, then the compound isolated is not impure salicylic acid, but unreacted benzoic acid. The melting point range is always a better indicator of the purity of a compound. A pure compound will have a very narrow range, or spread, as it melts. If impure, then the melting point becomes broad as well as depressed from the literature value. The key point required from students was the understanding that the range of melting point indicated the degree of purity and the relative proximity to the literature value indicated the likelihood of it being a specific compound.",,2
Science,Chemistry,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCECHER,VCECHERGC,General Comments,,"This concept was assessed in Question 8b.iv. Resolution is a quantity directly linked to the ability of a piece of equipment to provide a numerical value for a measurement, and needs to contain units for this value. The display of the electronic balance used in the question was digital and therefore has a fixed resolution defined by the final digit it can display (in this case 0.1 g). Many students were able to successfully identify this. The determination of the resolution of the burette was more problematic. As explained in the VCE Chemistry Study Design on pages 18 and 19, a value can only be quoted with a volume of 0.5 mL if this measurement was taken from a burette that had graduations marked every 1 mL; therefore the resolution of this burette is 1 mL.",,3
Science,Chemistry,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCECHER,VCECHERGC,General Comments,,"This concept was assessed in Q6d.i-v. In general, the concepts underpinning the use of integration curves were understood; however, often the language used in student responses did not align with the specific prompts.",,4
Science,Chemistry,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCECHER,VCECHERGC,General Comments,,"This concept was assessed in Q3c.iii. This question used the key word 'predict', which allowed students to give multiple valid responses, which greatly benefited the ability of students to respond. The key understanding students needed was to identify both the number and type of specific bonds that differed between these two compounds, and then use the data provided in the Data Book to predict an outcome. For future reference, students could be expected to provide a clear overall understanding of the nature of enthalpy changes based on more simplistic structures. When in this situation, students will need an understanding that bond enthalpies are based on the average energies required to break a bond type (endothermic process) and form new bonds (exothermic processes).",,5
Science,Chemistry,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCECHER,VCECHERGC,General Comments,,"In general, this was not understood well. Students should ensure that they can demonstrate a greater degree of competence in writing these equations.",,6
Science,Chemistry,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCECHER,VCECHERGC,General Comments,,Students should thoroughly practise the use of stoichiometry to determine correct answers for both the multiple-choice and short answer section of this examination.,,7
Science,Chemistry,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCECHER,VCECHERGC,General Comments,,"It is very important that students follow instructions to supply information in specific locations on the examination paper (such as in Questions 2d.ii and 7c.ii). If their response is placed in another location, it may not be identified as a response by the assessor and cannot be assessed.",,8
Science,Chemistry,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCECHER,VCECHERGC,General Comments,,"If a unit is not supplied in the stem of a question, then it is essential for a correct unit to be quoted along with the calculated value. For example, in Question 7b.ii the stem of the question stated 'Calculate the mass of LiC6 produced ...'; the answer '3.68' needed units of grams in order to be awarded full marks.",,9
Science,Chemistry,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCECHER,VCECHERGC,General Comments,,"To aid the interpretation of information, diagrams can be extremely beneficial for some students. Question 7a is a typical example of where this greatly assists students' responses.",,10
Science,Chemistry,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCECHER,VCECHERGC,General Comments,,"When using enthalpy values in energy calculations, care must be taken when including the negative sign associated with exothermic processes. Students who left the negative sign in these calculations ended up with negative final answers, and this suggests that a negative energy is transferred, which is not a valid concept. This was frequently seen in answers to Question 5a.i, where responses for the energy released were quoted as −28.8 kJ. This also occurred in Question 5b.ii, where students used the −49 kJ mol-1 enthalpy value and calculated a negative temperature change for an exothermic process.",,11
