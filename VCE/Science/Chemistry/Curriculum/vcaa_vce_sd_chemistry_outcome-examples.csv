Having both sites means a change in pH in either direction impacts the relative ratio of -NH3+ and -COO-, which in turn varies how the dye interacts with the wool.",,,,38

They discussed the different environment conditions at various points in the river, such as shaded or exposed sites, and treed versus cleared areas. One environmentally conscious student noted that a public picnic ground abutted the river and that paper, plastic and food scraps often ended up in the river. Another student referred to sections of the river allocated to swimming and boating activities and wondered whether factors such as body oils and turbulence affected water quality. From this discussion students formulated a number of research questions for investigation, based on a general question: How does water quality differ at various points along a river?",,,,61

The molar enthalpy of ethanol and the heat content of the biscuits are calculated from these results. The results are presented in two tables, one for ethanol and one for the biscuit. The photographs are printed and appropriately labelled to show the conditions used for each trial.",,,,59
