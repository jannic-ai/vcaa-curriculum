Science,Chemistry,Years 11 and 12,,VCECH12OVSC01,Scope of study,,Paragraph,"The study of VCE Chemistry involves investigating and analysing the composition and behaviour of matter, and the chemical processes involved in producing useful materials for society in ways that minimise adverse effects on human health and the environment. Chemistry underpins the generation of energy for use in homes and industry, the maintenance of clean air and water, the production of food, medicines and new materials, and the treatment of wastes.",,1
Science,Chemistry,Years 11 and 12,,VCECH12OVSC02,Scope of study,,Paragraph,"An important feature of undertaking a VCE science study is the opportunity for students to engage in a range of scientific investigation methodologies, to develop key science skills, and to interrogate the links between knowledge, theory and practice. Students work collaboratively as well as independently on a range of scientific investigations involving controlled experiments, fieldwork, case studies, classification and identification, modelling, simulations, literature reviews, and the development of a product, process or system. Knowledge and application of the safety considerations, including use of safety data sheets, and ethical guidelines associated with undertaking investigations is integral to the study of VCE Chemistry.",,2
Science,Chemistry,Years 11 and 12,,VCECH12OVSC03,Scope of study,,Paragraph,"As well as increasing their understanding of scientific processes, students develop insights into how knowledge in chemistry has changed, and continues to change, in response to new evidence, discoveries and thinking. They explore the impact of chemistry on their own lives, and on society and the environment. They develop capacities that enable them to critically assess the strengths and limitations of science, respect evidence-based conclusions and gain an awareness of the ethical contexts of scientific endeavours. Students consider how science is connected to innovation in addressing contemporary chemistry-based challenges.",,3
Science,Chemistry,Years 11 and 12,,VCECH12OVRA01,Rationale,,Paragraph,"VCE Chemistry enables students to investigate a range of chemical, biochemical and geophysical phenomena through the exploration of the nature of chemicals and chemical processes. Sustainability principles, concepts and goals are used to consider how useful materials for society may be produced with the least possible adverse effects on human health and the environment. In undertaking this study, students apply chemical principles to explain and quantify the behaviour of matter, as well as undertake practical activities that involve the analysis and synthesis of a variety of materials.",,1
Science,Chemistry,Years 11 and 12,,VCECH12OVRA02,Rationale,,Paragraph,"In VCE Chemistry, students develop and enhance a range of inquiry skills, such as practical experimentation, research and analytical skills, problem-solving skills including critical and creative thinking, and communication skills. Students pose questions, formulate hypotheses, conduct investigations, and analyse and critically interpret qualitative and quantitative data. They assess the limitations of data, evaluate methodologies and results, justify their conclusions, make recommendations and communicate their findings. Students apply chemical knowledge, scientific skills, and critical and creative thinking to investigate and analyse contemporary chemistry-related issues and communicate their views from an informed position.",,2
Science,Chemistry,Years 11 and 12,,VCECH12OVRA03,Rationale,,Paragraph,"VCE Chemistry provides for continuing study pathways within the discipline and can lead to a range of careers. Branches of chemistry include organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, analytical chemistry, physical chemistry and biochemistry. In addition, chemistry is applied in many fields of human endeavour including agriculture, bushfire research, dentistry, dietetics, education, engineering, environmental science, forensic science, forestry, horticulture, medicine, metallurgy, meteorology, nursing, pharmacy, sports science, toxicology, veterinary science and viticulture.",,3
