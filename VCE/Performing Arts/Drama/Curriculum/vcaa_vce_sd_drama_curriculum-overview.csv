Performing Arts,Drama,Years 11 and 12,,VCEDR12OVSC01,Scope of study,,Paragraph,"VCE Drama focuses on the creation and performance of characters and stories that communicate ideas, meaning and messages using contemporary drama-making practices. Students engage with creative processes, explore and respond to stimulus material, and apply play-making techniques to develop and present devised work. Students learn about, and draw on, a range of performance styles and conventions through the investigation of work by a diverse range of drama practices and practitioners, including Australian drama practitioners.",,1
Performing Arts,Drama,Years 11 and 12,,VCEDR12OVSC02,Scope of study,,Paragraph,"Students explore characteristics of selected performance styles and apply and manipulate conventions, dramatic elements, and production areas, including sustainable ways to source and apply production areas. They use performance skills and expressive skills to explore and develop character(s). Within the scope of this study, students will create performances that include transformation of character, time and place, and application of symbol. The created works can occur in any space and be performed for any selected audience. The work created may pass comment on or respond to aspects of real-world issues including political, social and cultural. Students reflect on, analyse and evaluate the development and performance of their own work, and the work and performances of other drama practitioners.",,2
Performing Arts,Drama,Years 11 and 12,,VCEDR12OVRA01,Rationale,,Paragraph,"In VCE Drama, students tell stories, explore ideas, make sense of their worlds and communicate meaning through the practice of performance-making. The study of drama enables students' individual and collective identities to be explored, expressed and validated. Students develop an ability to empathise through understanding and accepting diversity. Students draw from, and respond to, contexts and stories that reflect different cultures, genders, sexualities and abilities.",,1
Performing Arts,Drama,Years 11 and 12,,VCEDR12OVRA02,Rationale,,Paragraph,"VCE Drama connects students to multiple traditions of drama practice across a range of social, historical and cultural contexts including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples' artistic practice. Through the processes of devising and performing drama, students investigate self and others by exploring and responding to the contexts, narratives and diverse stories that shape their worlds.",,2
Performing Arts,Drama,Years 11 and 12,,VCEDR12OVRA03,Rationale,,Paragraph,"The study of drama introduces students to theories, processes and practices for the creative development of new work. Drama allows them to develop skills as creative and critical thinkers. Students develop an appreciation of drama as an art form through their work as solo and ensemble creators and performers, and their engagement with professional contemporary drama practices, by attending professional performances. They develop skills of communication, criticism and aesthetic understanding as both artists and audiences.",,3
Performing Arts,Drama,Years 11 and 12,,VCEDR12OVRA04,Rationale,,Paragraph,"VCE Drama equips students with knowledge, skills and confidence to communicate individually and collaboratively in a broad range of social, cultural and work-related contexts. The study of drama may provide pathways to training and tertiary study in acting, dramaturgy, directing, theatre production, theatre-making, script-writing, marketing, communication and drama criticism.",,4
