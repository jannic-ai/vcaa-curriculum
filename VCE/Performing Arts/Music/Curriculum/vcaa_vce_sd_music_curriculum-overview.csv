Performing Arts,Music,Years 11 and 12,,VCEMU12OVSC01,Scope of study,,Paragraph,"VCE Music is based on active engagement in all aspects of music. Students develop and refine musicianship skills and knowledge and develop a critical awareness of their relationship with music as listeners, performers, creators and music makers. Students explore, reflect on and respond to the music they listen to, create and perform. They analyse and evaluate live and recorded performances, and learn to incorporate, adapt and interpret musical practices from diverse cultures, times and locations into their own learning about music as both a social and cultural practice. Students study and practise ways of effectively communicating and expressing musical ideas to an audience as performers and composers, and respond to musical works as
an audience. The developed knowledge and skills provide a practical foundation for students to compose, arrange, interpret, reimagine, improvise and critique music in an informed manner.",,1
Performing Arts,Music,Years 11 and 12,,VCEMU12OVSC02,Scope of study,,Paragraph,"In this study students are offered a range of pathways that acknowledge and support a variety of student backgrounds and music learning contexts, including formal and informal.",,2
Performing Arts,Music,Years 11 and 12,,VCEMU12OVRA01,Rationale,,Paragraph,"Music is uniquely an aural art form and its essential nature is abstract. It is a complex socio-cultural phenomenon that exists distinctively in every culture and is a basic expression and reflection of human experience. It allows for the expression of the intellect, imagination and emotion, and the exploration of values, and fosters an understanding of continuity and change. Active participation in music develops musicianship through creating, performing, responding and analysing, and fosters an understanding of other times, places, cultures and contexts. Students develop ideas about the ways in which music can interact with other art forms, technology and design, and other fields of endeavour.",,1
Performing Arts,Music,Years 11 and 12,,VCEMU12OVRA02,Rationale,,Paragraph,"Music learning has a significant impact on the cognitive, affective, motor, social, cultural and personal competencies of students. It supports and encourages flexible cognitive and behavioural skills, and creativity, which are further enhanced by the non-verbal communication methods found in musical socialisation. Students learn to pose and solve problems, work independently and in collaboration, and create and convey meaning from various viewpoints. The nature of music study allows students to develop their capacity to manage their own learning, work together with others, and engage in activity that reflects the real-world practice of performers, composers and audiences, development of a personal voice.",,2
Performing Arts,Music,Years 11 and 12,,VCEMU12OVRA03,Rationale,,Paragraph,"Through performance, students sing and play music, demonstrating their knowledge and practical music skills through refining solo and/or ensemble performances. Students realise music ideas through the demonstration and interpretation of music elements and concepts to convey meaning and/or emotion to
an audience.",,3
Performing Arts,Music,Years 11 and 12,,VCEMU12OVRA04,Rationale,,Paragraph,"Through creating, students explore the manipulation of sound, producing new music works and arrangements. Using the music elements and concepts, students apply their knowledge and understanding of compositional devices to their own creations and the works of others.",,4
Performing Arts,Music,Years 11 and 12,,VCEMU12OVRA05,Rationale,,Paragraph,"Through responding and analysing, students investigate and explain the use of music elements, concepts and compositional devices, and respond to music from a variety of contexts, styles and genres. They develop knowledge and skills in identifying and understanding how music is organised, how effect is created and how influences and cultural contexts are manifested in works.",,5
Performing Arts,Music,Years 11 and 12,,VCEMU12OVRA06,Rationale,,Paragraph,VCE Music equips students with personal and musical knowledge and skills that enable them to focus on their musicianship in particular areas and follow pathways into tertiary music study or further training in a broad spectrum of music related careers. VCE Music also offers students opportunities for personal development and encourages them to make an ongoing contribution to the culture of their community through participation in life-long music making.,,6
