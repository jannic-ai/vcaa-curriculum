Which thou takest from me.
This island is mine, given to me by my mother
Sycorax. You took it from me.
When thou camest first,
Thou strok'st me and made much of me,
wouldst give me
Water with berries in
When you first came here, you petted me and
treated me well. You would give me water with
berries in it,
and teach me how
To name the bigger light, and how the less,
That burn by day and night.
and you taught me the names for the sun burning
in the daytime sky and the moon which lights
the night.
And then I loved thee
And showed thee all the qualities o' th' isle,
The fresh springs, brine pits, barren place
and fertile.
I loved you then, and I showed you all the
features of the island-the freshwater springs,
the saltwater pits, the places that were good for
growing things and those that were not.
Cursed be I that did so! All the charms
Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!
A curse on me for doing all that! May all the
evil spells of Sycorax torment you with toads,
beetles, and bats!
For I am all the subjects that you have,
Which first was mine own king.
I'm the only subject you have on this island,
where once I was my own king.
And here you sty me
In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me
The rest o' th' island.
[...]
And now you keep me confined in this cave and
don't let me go anywhere else on the island.
[...]
You taught me language, and my profit on
Is I know how to curse.
You taught me language, and all I gained from it
is that I now know how to curse.
The red plague rid you
For learning me your language!
May you die of the plague for teaching me
your language!
