I would undertake the planning activity of researching historical female leaders such as the Amazons in Greek mythology and take notes on how power is wielded by females in comparison to males to aid in this recontextualisation.

As the storm scene will have flashing lights and big bulky set pieces, it is important to recognise that during the chaos and confusion, actors may have difficulty seeing and moving through parts of the stage safely. Walking through the set will help to make sure that all cast and crew are aware of possible hazards, including parts of the set that are on different levels. During a tech rehearsal, I can watch to ensure that the actors can move around and interact with the set safely, particularly when there are different levels of light being applied. If a part of the set is found to be risky during the tech rehearsal, I can adapt that part of the set (e.g. by adding padding or reflective tape) or adjust the positioning of the problematic part of the set. Alternatively, some of the actors' blocking can be refined during the tech rehearsal to accommodate my set, or some of the lighting states can be adjusted to help the actors move around the set more safely during the storm scene. The aim of checking the set during the tech rehearsal is to ensure that during the performance, even though it looks chaotic, the actors are not actually in danger of hurting themselves during the storm scene.",,38

In this moment, using a forceful and purposeful gait to approach Prospero with resentment, I would discuss with the set designer to see if there could be any platforms or stairs on stage I could stand on in the moment, to further bring prominence to his anger towards Prospero. I would stand with a defiant posture, gazing sternly at Prospero, as an attempt for Caliban to regain his power that was stripped away, the stern gaze symbolising his hatred to Prospero.",,43

On this line, I would raise my head, gazing longingly out towards the audience (presentational style acting - convention) to bring prominence to the high status that Caliban once had, when he was king. After this line, I would take a long, meaningful pause, dropping my head with my chin to my chest and hunching my shoulders, emphasising how Caliban has now lost all his status as he is under the control of Prospero. Inspired by image 3, I would then turn around and face the back of the stage as I say, 'And now you keep me confined in this cave', using a quiet and downward inflection to bring further prominence to his low status and lack of power.",,47

Performing Arts,Theatre Studies,,,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCETSERB,VCETS25EQB1,VCETSERBCM,,Question 1,ExaminerCommentary,"In Monkey Baa's production of Yong, actor Alan Zhu and the set design effectively conveyed the play's context of Chinese migration to Australia, incorporating aspects of both children's theatre and historical drama. Creatively creating a set design that resembled a travelling cart, the two flats featured stage left and right were made out of sandy wood that was grainy in colour and had different equipment for gold panning and camping, such as lamps, tents, wok, gold pan and shovel hanging on the flats. Creatively implementing a wheel as well on the stage left flat that would begin to spin any time there was a 'click of the reins' emphasising the set's resemblance to a travelling cart and its wheels allowing it to move. The choice to have a set design like this clearly communicated the play as speaking to real life events of the gold rush in Australia (convention of historical drama), as travelling carts were commonly used when travelling long distances like Yong and others had to do to get from Robe to Ballarat. Moreover, Zhu's exaggerated characterisation and physicality (convention of children's theatre) skilfully conveyed the mental and physical struggle of a migrant's journey. In the travel sequence scene, Zhu, acting as Yong, moves from downstage right to downstage left and then upstage centre with a lot of agility. He takes long strides with a quick pace, his shoulders are held high, his head is turning and eyes darting to take in his surroundings. This then varies a second time around. After 'Yong stumbles back and resumes walking', Zhu's posture becomes hunched, his strides are smaller, have a slower pace and his feet become heavy. His eyeline is low and his eyebrows are furrowed and mouth closed. This variation in energy and explicit use of exaggerated physicality is effective in appealing to the intended audience of young children. It conveys the mental and physical toll which the travel journey had on characters but also thought-provoking comments on the mental hardships migrants have had to deal with as racism is still prevalent in our society today. Zhu's exaggerated acting skilfully spotlighted how a change needs to occur in Australia's racism, educating young audiences to learn, grow and put an end to the toxic cyclical cycle [sic] affecting many Chinese and other immigrants.",,8

An example of this is in the transition from Act 1, Scene 1 to Scene 2, where the intensity in lighting shifts dramatically. At the end of 'Skater Planet' a spectacle is created where pulsating, flashing, vibrant disco-like lights fill the stage, creating the exposition for the intended meaning of living life to the fullest, symbolised by full and bright colours created from the lighting rig. To vary this intensity and depict Kimberly's complex family relationships, Scott shifts the lighting to a dull, blue wash that gently covers the stage, with a soft spotlight downstage right, illuminating Kimberly and her Dad. This variation in intensity beautifully captured the transition from the resilience and hope portrayed in the opening number to the struggles and difficult life circumstances lived by Kimberly because of her complex family relationships, thus inviting the audience to empathise with her situation.",,7

Performing Arts,Theatre Studies,,,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCETSERC,VCETS25EQC1,VCETSERCCM,,Question 1b,ExaminerCommentary,"From the outset of the play, Arundell masterfully harnesses the tempo and pace of her speech; beginning with the lines, 'Can you hear me?' Arundell utilises a deliberately slow pace in her speech. This slow pace effectively engenders a sense of calm in the audience and cultivates an intimate actor-audience relationship, as audiences feel soothed by and close to the character of Tessa. In Act 3 Scene 2, Arundell harnesses this actor-audience intimacy previously established and manipulates audience experience of the harrowing scene in which the character Tessa is running from the birds. On her lines, 'They watched me', Arundell gradually increases the pace and tempo of both her speech and her footsteps. By the line, 'I ran', Arundell's pace of speech is fast and panicked, and the up-tempo, staccato rhythm of her footsteps create a stressful, underlying sense of urgency. This effective utilisation of rhythm masterfully enriches audience experience of the scene, engendering an empathic response of distress and thus proficiently cultivating a high degree of intimacy in the actor-audience relationship.",,12
