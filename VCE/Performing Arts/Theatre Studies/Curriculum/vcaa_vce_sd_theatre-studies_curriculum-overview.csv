Performing Arts,Theatre Studies,Years 11 and 12,,VCETS12OVSC01,Scope of study,,Paragraph,"In VCE Theatre Studies, students interpret scripts from historic periods to the present day and produce theatre for audiences. Through practical and theoretical engagement with scripts, they gain an insight into the origins and development of theatre, the influences of theatre on cultures and societies, and the influences of culture and society on theatre. Students apply dramaturgy and work in the production roles of actor, director and designer, developing an understanding and appreciation of the role of theatre practitioners.",,1
Performing Arts,Theatre Studies,Years 11 and 12,,VCETS12OVSC02,Scope of study,,Paragraph,"Throughout the study, students work individually and collaboratively in production roles to interpret scripts and to plan, develop and present productions. Students study the contexts of scripts (time and place, including the historical, cultural, political and social contexts) and the languages of scripts, as well as theatre movements. They experiment with different possibilities for interpreting scripts and apply ideas and concepts for presentation to audiences. They examine ways in which meaning can be constructed and conveyed through theatre performance. Students consider their audiences and, in their interpretations, incorporate knowledge and understanding of audience culture and demographics.",,2
Performing Arts,Theatre Studies,Years 11 and 12,,VCETS12OVSC03,Scope of study,,Paragraph,"Students learn about innovations in theatre production across different times, cultures and places and apply this knowledge to their work. Through the study of scripts, theatre styles and contemporary theatre movements, and by working in production roles to interpret scripts, students develop knowledge and understanding of theatre, its conventions and elements of theatre composition. Students analyse and evaluate the production of professional theatre performances and consider the relationship to their own theatre production work. They consider their dual roles as artist and as audience. Students learn about and demonstrate an understanding of safe, ethical, inclusive, sustainable (where possible, environmentally sustainable) and responsible personal and interpersonal work practices in theatre production.",,3
Performing Arts,Theatre Studies,Years 11 and 12,,VCETS12OVRA01,Rationale,,Paragraph,"Theatre as a form of cultural expression has been made and performed for audiences from the earliest times and is an integral part of all cultures. Theatre is ever evolving and exists as entertainment, education, ritual, an agent for change, a representation of values and a critical window on society. Theatre practice has developed from, and been influenced by, cultures over many centuries through a wide variety of productions in diverse performance spaces for a range of audiences. Theatre-makers work as playwrights, actors, dramaturgs, directors and designers, producing theatre for diverse purposes.",,1
Performing Arts,Theatre Studies,Years 11 and 12,,VCETS12OVRA02,Rationale,,Paragraph,"Through the study of VCE Theatre Studies, students develop, refine and enhance their analytical, evaluative and critical thinking skills as well as creative expression, technical application, problem-solving, collaborative and communication skills. They work both individually and in collaboration with others to interpret scripts. Through theoretical study and creative practice, students develop their aesthetic understanding and appreciation of the art form of theatre, and their interpretive and theatre production skills. Through the study of theatre, students also explore world views, alternative perspectives and ways of being.",,2
Performing Arts,Theatre Studies,Years 11 and 12,,VCETS12OVRA03,Rationale,,Paragraph,"The study of theatre, in its various forms, prepares students for further study in theatre production, theatre history, communication, marketing, production management, writing, acting, direction and design at tertiary level. VCE Theatre Studies also prepares students for further learning in vocational educational training settings or for industry or community-related pathways.",,3
