In the opening scene, the interplay between set design and acting sets the tone for the comedic style of the performance. The minimalist set, featuring exaggerated Victorian furniture, immediately places the audience in a heightened, satirical version of Wilde's world. The actors' physical comedy, characterised by exaggerated movements and facial expressions, enhances the absurdity of the setting. This combination of set design and acting establishes the play's comedic and satirical tone, engaging the audience from the start.",,,,16

In the garden scene, lighting and costume design work together with the actors' performances to highlight the contrasts between characters. The bright, whimsical lighting underscores the playful banter between Gwendolen and Cecily, while their elaborate, period-accurate costumes emphasise their social status and personalities. The actors' precise timing and delivery of Wilde's witty dialogue, combined with the visual elements, create a cohesive and engaging comedic moment that reflects the themes of identity and social conventions.",,,,18

In the final revelation scene, the use of sound design and direction enhances the dramatic irony and comedic payoff. The director's staging choices, such as positioning the characters to maximise visual humour and timing of their reactions, work in tandem with sound effects to punctuate key moments of the dialogue. The actors' performances, marked by their physical reactions and vocal inflections, draw out the humour in the characters' misunderstandings and realisations. This combination of sound, direction, and acting culminates in a satisfying and entertaining conclusion to the play.",,,,20
