It attempts
to explain how and why people behave the way they do and the consequences of their decision-making. By unpacking the economic considerations around how to best meet the needs and wants of citizens, the study of Economics provides students with valuable insight into issues that may affect them both individually and as members of society. Economics assists us in making more informed and responsible decisions and in making a contribution to public debate as active citizens.",,1

Developing students' understanding of economics will enable them to appreciate the reasons behind these decisions as well as the intended and unintended consequences of economic decision-making. Acquisition of economics knowledge and skills assists students to make more informed and responsible economic decisions and contribute to public discourse as informed citizens.",,1

They undertake independent inquiry, think critically and work collaboratively with their peers to develop viable solutions to contemporary economic issues. They consider the way in which economic agents respond to incentives, disincentives, make trade-offs, weigh up costs and benefits and make judgments about what is efficient and what is fair. They utilise economic models and the tools of economists effectively to analyse and evaluate the decisions made by key economic agents. In the process students appreciate the different viewpoints about issues that may affect the modern economy and broader society.",,2

These skills can be used across many employment fields, including foreign affairs, banking, finance, health, environment and education. Economics leads to a broad range of career options such as economist, journalist, public policy advisor, political consultant, media commentator, entrepreneur, business owner, environmental manager, investment banker, investment analyst, management consultant, business analyst, actuary, accountant, academic, teacher, stockbroker, banker, town planner and many more.",,3
