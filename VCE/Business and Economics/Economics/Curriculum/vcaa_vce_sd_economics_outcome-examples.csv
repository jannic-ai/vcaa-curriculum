The equilibrium price and the quantity traded both increase. In this example, a drop in the price of consoles causes consumers to demand more of the complementary product - controllers. Graphically, the demand curve shifts from D1 to D2. At the initial price P1, a shortage will occur; that is, QD>QS/Q1. This shortage will cause the equilibrium price to increase from P1 to P2. This signals to producers to allocate more resources to the production of controllers, shown as an upward movement along the supply curve; that is, an expansion in the quantity supplied. As a result of the higher price, some consumers will 'drop out' of the market, while others will cut back on their purchases. This is shown as an upward movement along the demand curve; that is, a contraction in quantity demanded.
