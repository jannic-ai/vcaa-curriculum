Business and Economics,Economics,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEECER,VCEECERGC,General Comments,,"Students performed quite well in the examination. In Section A, many of the 15 multiple-choice questions were well handled.",,0
Business and Economics,Economics,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEECER,VCEECERGC,General Comments,,"However, Questions 3 and 5 in Section A had the highest incidence of incorrect responses, suggesting that teachers and students need to carefully revise the following key knowledge areas as part of examination preparation:",,1
Business and Economics,Economics,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEECER,VCEECERGC,General Comments,,"how price factors and non-price factors affect the demand curve. That is, the former lead to movements along the demand curve while the latter cause shifts of the demand curve (Question 3)",,2
Business and Economics,Economics,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEECER,VCEECERGC,General Comments,,the meaning of relative prices (Question 5).,,3
Business and Economics,Economics,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEECER,VCEECERGC,General Comments,,"Overall, students responded to most of the questions in Section B in a meaningful way and structured their responses well. However, some points to note are:",,4
Business and Economics,Economics,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEECER,VCEECERGC,General Comments,,"Students must carefully choose when (and when not) to define macroeconomic goals in their responses. If a goal is in one component of a question, a definition is not expected or required for the rest of that component; for example, if they provide a definition in Question 4c., they do not need to provide a definition again in Question 4d.",,5
Business and Economics,Economics,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEECER,VCEECERGC,General Comments,,"Further, students must commit key economic definitions from the study design to memory as it was evident in the responses to Questions 1, 2b. and 4a. that a number of students had a tenuous grasp of the terms featured in these questions.",,6
Business and Economics,Economics,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEECER,VCEECERGC,General Comments,,"The task word and the total marks per question provide important information about how much detail is required and the approach to be taken in responding to a question. Therefore, students need to carefully consider how much detail is needed in each response based on these two things. For example, in Question 2a., there was no need for an equilibrium adjustment analysis and in Question 4a. there was no need for an evaluation of the achievement of the goal or a statement about the current rate of inflation.",,7
Business and Economics,Economics,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEECER,VCEECERGC,General Comments,,"Question 4d. proved to be another area where more preparation is required, as many responses did not provide a balanced assessment in relation to the achievement of the two macroeconomic goals. Evaluation, in the context of this question, required students to consider relevant information such as the benchmarks (official or unofficial targets) for the macroeconomic goals of low and stable inflation and full employment, and to make a judgment based on a knowledge and understanding of Australia's inflation and unemployment performance over the past 2 years, while also considering points for and against whether the macroeconomic goals in question have been achieved or not.",,8
Business and Economics,Economics,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEECER,VCEECERGC,General Comments,,"Overall, responses did not score highly in Questions 5a. and 5b., suggesting that Area of Study 3 from Unit 3 needs to be singled out for further consolidation and revision. For example, for Question 5a., many responses did not identify a relevant structural influence on the current account, while other responses referred to cyclical influences on the current account, which was not what the question asked. For Question 5b., many responses did not demonstrate how foreign investment is treated in the balance of payments.",,9
Business and Economics,Economics,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEECER,VCEECERGC,General Comments,,Students are expected to write responses in full sentences and paragraphs. Some students used shorthand consisting of arrows and economic symbols. This approach could not convey the complexity and sophistication of economic relationships and meant that these responses did not obtain the full complement of marks allocated to a question.,,10
Business and Economics,Economics,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEECER,VCEECERGC,General Comments,,Students who use the extra space at the back of the booklet to finish their answers should make it very clear to assessors that their answer continues beyond the space allocated in the answer booklet. Simply writing 'P.T.O.' at the end of the allotted writing space is sufficient. Students who do not do this risk assessors ignoring the part of their response at the back of the booklet.,,11
Business and Economics,Economics,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEECER,VCEECERGC,General Comments,,"It is important to explain the links between concepts in economics. Many responses contained simplistic assertions without explaining why these relationships exist. In general, students must ensure they 'explain' rather than 'assert' economic relationships. The examples provided below demonstrate how students can write a more complete response that addresses the requirements of the question.",,12
Business and Economics,Economics,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEECER,VCEECERGC,General Comments,,Examples where 'assertions' are extended into 'explanations':,,13
Business and Economics,Economics,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEECER,VCEECERGC,General Comments,,"'An increase in AD [aggregate demand] leads to an increase in inflation' would be better phrased as 'an increase in AD leads to more pressure on the capacity of the Australian economy, leading to shortages and price pressures, which accelerate inflation'.",,14
Business and Economics,Economics,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEECER,VCEECERGC,General Comments,,"'An increase in AD leads to an increase in economic growth' would be better phrased as 'an increase in AD sends signals to suppliers to increase production levels, leading to an increase in economic growth'.",,15
Business and Economics,Economics,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEECER,VCEECERGC,General Comments,,"'An increase in AS [aggregate supply] leads to an increase in production' would be better phrased as 'an increase in AS puts downward pressure on prices, stimulating AD for the increased level of output/production'.",,16
Business and Economics,Economics,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEECER,VCEECERGC,General Comments,,"'An increase in productivity means an increase in the productive capacity' would be better phrased as 'an increase in productivity allows firms to get more outputs from the same level of inputs, expanding the economy's productive capacity or potential output, hence increasing the willingness and/or ability of businesses to supply goods and services for sale'.",,17
Business and Economics,Economics,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEECER,VCEECERGC,General Comments,,"'An increase in production or AD leads to more jobs in the economy' would be better phrased as 'an increase in production means firms require more labour in the production process to satisfy the increased demand, which leads to an increase in derived demand for labour and an increase in jobs or a decrease in the unemployment rate'.",,18
Business and Economics,Economics,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEECER,VCEECERGC,General Comments,,"Many responses did not demonstrate understanding of the distinction between purchasing power and disposable income. These concepts are not interchangeable. Disposable income measures (in nominal terms) wages paid to employees minus taxes paid to the government plus any transfer payments received, whereas purchasing power measures the amount of goods and services a given level of income can purchase (which is determined by inflation). For example, an increase in inflation means the same level of disposable income has a reduced 'purchasing power' because goods and services are more expensive, but it does not equate to a decrease in disposable income.",,19
Business and Economics,Economics,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEECER,VCEECERGC,General Comments,,"It is important that students have a contemporary understanding of the Australian economy, as per the study design. For example, Questions 4b., 4c., 4d., 6a., 6b. and 6d. all required a contemporary understanding to receive full marks. Students should note that where the study design states 'over the past 2 years', both a theoretical and a contemporary understanding are required.",,20
