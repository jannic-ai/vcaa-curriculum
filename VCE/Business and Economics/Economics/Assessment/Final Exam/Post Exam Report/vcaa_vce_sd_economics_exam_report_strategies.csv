Business and Economics,Economics,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEECERB,VCEEC24EQB1,VCEECERBER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 1,StudentResponse,The following is an example of a high-scoring response.,"Relative scarcity is the basic economic problem that a society's wants/needs are infinite whereas our resources are finite. This forces economic agents to make decisions on how these resources are going to be allocated. This results in opportunity costs which is the value of the next best alternative foregone when making an economic decision. For example, a farmer may have land which is allocated to the production of wheat. However, the opportunity cost of allocating this scarce resource could've been the value of using the land to produce rice (if this is the next best alternative).",11

Business and Economics,Economics,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEECERB,VCEEC24EQB2,VCEECERBER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 2b,StudentResponse,The following is an example of a high-scoring response:,"The net migration of 315,000 in 2023-24 will increase Australia's population and thus shift the demand curve for housing to the right. This may cause a shortage of housing at the pre-existing price level, causing profit-seeking suppliers to increase prices to eliminate this shortage. This should lead to an expansion in the supply of housing and a contraction in the demand for housing until a new equilibrium is reached with a high quantity [traded] and a higher price.",38

High-scoring responses linked the increase in skilled migration to an increase in labour productivity or to an increase in the labour force participation rate, both of which expand the economy's potential output. Furthermore, some responses argued that the increase in the intake of skilled migrants helps to ease costs of production for Australian businesses due to a loosening of the labour market and the filling of skilled vacancies, and in doing so, increases the willingness and ability of businesses to supply goods and services",,41

Business and Economics,Economics,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEECERB,VCEEC24EQB2,VCEECERBCM,,Question 2c,ExaminerCommentary,"Therefore, it is important that students explain why an increase in one factor leads to a change in something else (see General comments section above). For example, if productivity increases (a favourable AS factor), businesses can get more output from the same inputs, allowing them to lower their per-unit costs of production, which makes businesses more willing and able to supply. The resultant increase in aggregate supply exerts downward pressure on the general price level, which stimulates aggregate demand for the increased output, promoting non-inflationary economic growth. Alternatively, students could argue that businesses may pass on these lower costs of production as lower prices to consumers, stimulating aggregate demand and supporting non-inflationary economic growth.",,58

Thus, productive capacity will shift out as a product of the quantity and quality of resources in the economy. Further, the higher labour productivity will increase capability to supply, improving aggregate supply and contributing to non-inflationary economic growth. This improves the achievement of strong and sustainable economic growth, as greater productive capacity allows firms to respond to greater aggregate demand.",60

It is often referred to as NAIRU (non-accelerating rate of unemployment) and is around 4.5 per cent. One consequence if the unemployment rate is below the NAIRU is that it could create high inflationary pressures, as firms experience labour shortages, leading to higher wages and [they] must increase prices to protect profit margins. With high inflation, this reduces the purchasing power of consumers' incomes and hence decreases the volume of goods and services they can consume (a decrease in material living standards).",91

Business and Economics,Economics,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEECERB,VCEEC24EQB4,VCEECERBER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 4c,StudentResponse,The following is an example of a high-scoring response:,"The current monetary policy stance is contractionary, whereby the target cash rate is set at 4.35 per cent above monetary policy neutrality (3-3.5 per cent). This is designed to decrease AD and promote the achievement of the goal of price stability since the inflation rate (3.8 in Q2 2023) has been above the target range of 2-3 per cent. The higher target cash rate should flow onto a higher interest rate which should (via the cash flow transmission mechanism) mean households with variable interest rate loans experience an increase in interest repayments, thereby decreasing their discretionary income. In response, households may cut back their private consumption spending (C), reducing AD. This decrease in AD may lead to surpluses emerging which would exert downward pressure on prices. Thus, the RBA's stance is designed to lower the inflation rate and promote this achievement of price stability (contain the annual CPI increase to 2-3 per cent on average over a cycle).",127

Business and Economics,Economics,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEECERB,VCEEC24EQB4,VCEECERBER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 4d,StudentResponse,The following is an example of a high-scoring response:,"The goal of low and stable inflation lies within a target range of 2-3 per cent on average, as measured by the CPI over the course of the business cycle. As it has been the RBA's primary goal, 'prioritising its inflation objective (goal)', they have implemented a contractionary monetary policy stance by tightening and increasing the target cash rate over the 2 years. With its 13 increases, it has helped inflation to fall from 7.8 per cent in December 2022 to 4.1 per cent in December 2023, to now a rate of 2.8 per cent in September 2024. This has pushed the rate of inflation just into the range of low and stable inflation. However, the reduction in inflation to 2.8 per cent may be the result of the energy bill relief rebate which directly reduced the headline inflation rate as $300 was taken off of households' energy bills. With the underlying rate of inflation, the measure of increases in price, excluding volatile items (e.g. government policies), is 3.5 per cent, still above the target range of 2-3 per cent. However, when considering the headline inflation rate of 2.8 per cent, it can be said that the goal of low and stable inflation has been achieved. Moreover, whilst they have prioritised their goal of inflation, it 'does not mean that employment has taken a back seat', with the rate of unemployment being 3.9 per cent in December 2023, below the goal of full employment, a target range of 4-4.5 per cent of natural unemployment, that does not include cyclical unemployment, and does not cause inflationary pressures, the contractionary stance of monetary policy may have helped to increase the rate of unemployment, with it being at 4.1 per cent as of September 2024. This pushes the rate just into the range of full employment. Overall, over the past 2 years, as a result of the contractionary monetary policy stance, the goal of low and stable inflation and the goal of full employment have been achieved.",142

Business and Economics,Economics,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEECERB,VCEEC24EQB5,VCEECERBER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 5d,StudentResponse,The following is an example of a high-scoring response:,"Trade liberalisation refers to the reduction/removal of barriers to trade, including the removal of tariffs, subsidies, quotas etc. The goal of strong and sustainable economic growth (SSEG) refers to the fastest rate of growth, consistent with high employment without causing excessive inflation, external instability and environmental pressures. This is generally 3-3.5% growth in real GDP p.a. In the short term, trade liberalisation should cause some inefficient industries/businesses to shut down as they are unable to compete with cheaper imports. This should reduce demand for labour increasing structural unemployment. This should reduce production and growth in real GDP, hurting the goal. In the long term, resources would be reallocated to areas of comparative advantage. Over time, firms will experience increased pressure to restructure. If firms can effectively restructure they should become more productive. This should reduce their production costs and increase their willingness to supply and boosting aggregate supply (AS). This should increase firms' willingness to produce and increase GDP. It should also allow any increase in AD to be met by AS, promoting non-inflationary economic growth, and helping to achieve the goal.",197

The implementation lag connected to budgetary policy tends to be long because of the need for the government to negotiate with opposition parties and the requirement for a budget bill to gain the approval of both houses of parliament.

Students are reminded that a short implementation lag and flexibility are two distinct strengths of monetary policy. The former refers to the speed with which the RBA can change interest rates, that is, any change in the cash rate usually flows onto interest rates applied by the banks to their customers within a few days; while flexibility refers to the eight opportunities the RBA has to change the cash rate in a calendar year and therefore interest rates more generally.

In the 2024-25 budget, $90 million was dedicated towards funding 20,000 places related to training construction workers. When these workers complete this training there is an increase in the average labour productivity level, allowing more outputs to be produced per labour input and contributing to technical efficiency in the future. This greater productivity paired with lower wages costs from a greater supply of labour increases firm's willingness and ability to supply. This increases aggregate supply, contributing to low inflationary growth, [and] with more productive firms able to reduce prices in order to gain a market share whilst maintaining profit margins, the international competitiveness of export competing firms will rise. E.g. relative lower prices from increased productivity improves the ability of Australia's tradable sector to compete with international firms. Furthermore, great international competitiveness leads to more AD (via X) and an increased production. Firms will require more labour to expand production, which reduces the rate of unemployment and brings the Australian economy closer to its goal of full employment (NAIRU 4.25 per cent).",269

This causes the decrease in global supply for coffee beans as the producers are less willing and able to produce coffee beans at all price points, represented by the leftward shift of supply curve from S1 to S2. Increasing disposable income globally could have increased the willingness and ability for coffee consumers to buy coffee as a good that is not necessary for survival. This causes coffee producers who use coffee beans to increase their demand for coffee at all price points, shown by the rightward shift of the demand curve for coffee beans from D1 to D2.

Coffee beans will have a relatively inelastic supply i.e. increase in price of 100% will only lead to 5% more of coffee beans produced. This is due to its long time of production where it typically takes a year for coffee beans to fully grow. However, over time, as new growing methods are introduced this will likely decrease the production period of coffee beans, meaning firms can quickly increase production levels if the price of coffee rises, making firms more responsive to price changes thus increasing the price elasticity of supply for coffee beans.",59

The cyclones and floods would have destroyed and damaged land and capital resources. Thus, the quality and quantity of factors of production fall. Thus, as the quality of these resources fall, per unit production costs rise. Thus, firms' overall costs of production rise, making firms less willing and able to produce, decreasing aggregate supply. Firms pass on higher costs of production as higher prices to consumers to maintain profit margins, increasing cost inflationary pressures given inflation has been high, with underlying inflation still on the upper end of the goal at 2.7%, despite headline being at 2.1%, this is highly likely to have put upwards pressure on the inflation rate, making it harder for Australia to lower inflation to within the goal, hindering the achievement of L&SI.",94

This reflects an incomplete understanding of both the goal of full employment and the role of the NAIRU. Unemployment below 4 per cent is only concerning to the extent that it generates excessive wages' growth, skills shortages and inflationary pressure. To this end, some students made a good argument that an unemployment rate in the mid- to high-3s during 2023 contributed to the unacceptably high inflation rate as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), resulting in the goal not being achieved in the sense that the unemployment rate was incompatible with the goal of low inflation at this time.

Business and Economics,Economics,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEECERB,VCEEC25EQB3,VCEECERBER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 3d,StudentResponse,The following is an example of a high-scoring response:,"The goal of Full Employment (FE) is to achieve the level of unemployment where cyclical unemployment is eliminated, and the unemployment rate is as low as possible without falling below the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU), estimated to be 4-4.5%. The unemployment rate has risen from 3.6% in March 2023 to 4.5% in September 2025. Over the last 2 years, Australia has managed to increase unemployment from below NAIRU estimates in 2023 to within the NAIRU range in 2024 and 2025, indicating Australia has achieved the goal. However, in 2023 unemployment remained below NAIRU. Furthermore, the fact that wages growth has been slow indicates that Australia may actually be operating above NAIRU, despite being within the estimated range. Ultimately, Australia failed to achieve FE in 2023 with unemployment being too low, and inflation being too high reflecting this at 7%. However, Australia has maintained unemployment within NAIRU for 2024 and 2025, and thus, Australia is currently achieving the goal of FE. However, Australia must be careful with unemployment expected to continue rising. As FE is being achieved, this indicated a good level of employment and also negates the consequences of loss of GDP, tax revenue or excessive inflation. Thus, given employment is sufficient, and the minimum wage is greater than welfare benefits, average disposable incomes are high, improving access to goods and services (material living standards). Furthermore, less people are prone to the stigma of being unemployed, improving quality of life and non-material living standards.",112

This could temporarily cause businesses that mostly exported to be out of business or to shut down, and overall the reduction of AD would disincentivise businesses' production, requiring less labour resources, increasing unemployment. However, in the long term, businesses would restructure to either produce goods and services with higher relative demand from Australian consumers or foreign non-US consumers where there are no tariffs.

Through the cash flow channel, any increases in discretionary income, as a result of lower interest payments, are more likely to be spent on repaying existing debts, rather than on consumption of goods and services (C). As such, the cash flow channel is relatively ineffective, causing a constrained ability for the RBA to stimulate AD, production and hence achieve a stronger rate of economic growth (and maintaining full employment), representing a weakness.",173

Whilst they adopted a less contractionary stance (taking their foot off the brake), the stance remains 'contractionary' as it is still above the range of monetary policy neutrality (3-3.5%). Via the savings and investment channel, the high cash rate (and thus general interest rates) will increase the incentive for households to save (as the reward is greater) and discourage borrowing for consumption (as repayments are higher), thus reducing consumption. Also, firms are discouraged from borrowing for investment, as future projects are less likely to meet the required hurdle rate of return (as repayments are higher), thus reducing investment. Via a fall in C and I, AD also falls and firms notice falling sales and rising stock levels, thus they lower their level of production (GDP), decreasing their derived demand for labour increasing cyclical unemployment and the unemployment rate. This worsens non-material living standards as more unemployed people experience a negative stigma and poorer self-esteem, However, holding the contractionary stance over the past two years has assisted in the achievement of full employment by lifting us to within the target range (since we were below for all of 2023), thus loosening the labour market and placing us within NAIRU.",189

Students are reminded that discretionary stabilisers are budgetary measures designed to influence AD and stabilise the business cycle in the short to medium term. While discretionary stabilisers such as new infrastructure spending do raise the economy's productive capacity and hence its potential to supply goods and services over the longer term, permitting the economy to absorb increases in AD to avoid destabilising inflationary booms (a significant peak in the business cycle), this argument was not made well by many students.",,216

Business and Economics,Economics,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEECERB,VCEEC25EQB6,VCEECERBER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 6b,StudentResponse,The following is an example of a high-scoring response:,"The announcement of the extension of the energy rebate for another 6 months in the 2025-26 budget outcome will see households' electricity bills reduce by $150 in total, $75 per quarter. Thus this will see a rise in discretionary income (factor income + welfare - direct taxes - necessities) as electricity is a necessity and has inelastic demand. This will thus increase C and hence the AD. Firms will thus notice rising sales and falling stock levels thus increasing production levels (GDP) hence increasing economic growth. As the current rate of economic growth is 1.8%, this will help assist in the achievement of the goal by making economic growth more 'strong' (increasing it closer to the unofficial target of 3-3.5%). Furthermore, as electricity is counted under 'housing policy' category in the CPI, this will help reduce the growth in the CPI and hence inflation rate, therefore making economic growth more 'sustainable' (causing less inflationary pressures) assisting with the achievement of the goal.",219

That is, they explained how both policies operate to influence AD but made no attempt to analyse the relative strengths and weaknesses of each policy in achieving the goal of low inflation. Students are reminded that a strength is a feature or aspect of budgetary or monetary policy that makes it particularly potent or effective in achieving a goal; while a weakness is a feature or aspect of budgetary or monetary policy that limits or constrains its effectiveness in achieving a goal. In this question, no marks were awarded for explaining how either policy works to impact inflation (the operation), without relevant reference to the strengths and weaknesses of the policy.",,232
Business and Economics,Economics,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEECERB,VCEEC25EQB6,VCEECERBER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 6c,StudentResponse,The following is an example of a high-scoring response:,"The goal of low and stable inflation (price stability) is to maintain general price levels in the economy, typically a rate of 2-3% inflation. In global uncertainty, one strength of monetary policy in particular is its lack of political bias. The RBA being an independent body would not be affected by changing political stances, making them focus solely on achieving this goal. This allows them to become more contractionary when required to reduce inflation, helping it to achieve price stability. One strength of budgetary policy during uncertainty is it swings into action automatically with automatic stabilisers. If tariffs increase and countries retaliate, it may decrease overseas economic growth and negatively impact economic growth and AD in Australia. Since the cyclical component automatically takes effect, it will quickly increase outlays via welfare payments and decrease receipts via lower tax payments if unemployment goes up. This allows it to maintain a higher inflation rate to protect it from going below 2-3% as going below can lead to delayed consumption etc. However, a weakness of monetary policy in particular is its inability to control cost inflation. In global uncertainty and when geopolitical events arise, the economy may have higher cost inflation as other countries may have high inflation and if Australia increases tariffs, increasing the price of intermediate goods required for production. Since the RBA can only control demand inflation, it makes it ineffective at targeting this cost inflation, reducing its ability to achieve price stability. Additionally, since budgetary policy is controlled by the government, political bias may increase cost inflation. During global uncertainty, the government may introduce tariffs, increasing the cost of imported intermediate goods which raises cost inflation, undermining its ability to achieve price stability.",233

Business and Economics,Economics,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEECERB,VCEEC25EQB7,VCEECERBER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 7a,StudentResponse,The following is an example of a high-scoring response:,"Although they are limiting immigration, our skilled immigration policy will still improve the quantity and quality of the factors of production, as it brings in (this year) 185,000 permanent migrants, 70% of which are skilled. These skilled migrants bring experiences and qualifications that are currently in shortage, thus they 'fill a gap' in our labour market e.g. nurses, engineers. This increases both supply of labour for firms (making them more able to produce) and increases labour productivity (output per worker per hour), as on average they are more proficient. As a result, labour productivity is more likely to outpace wages growth, reducing growth in Real Unit Labour Costs (RULCs), thus lowering per unit costs and overall costs of production for firms, making production more profitable and thus firms more willing and able to produce, increasing AS and productive capacity. This puts downwards pressure on prices and firms can pass on lower production costs as lower prices, reducing cost-inflation, and therefore overall inflation. This should assist in ensuring inflation does not rise above the target, especially after the energy rebate is removed, assisting the achievement of the goal by helping sustain an inflation rate of 2.3% per year on average over time. The government capping the amount of skilled immigration only reduces the positive impacts on AS, not completely removing them. However, since this cap was made in response to concerns over housing affordability, then this may assist the achievement of the goal by reducing population size, and thus limiting demand (and thus shortages) for housing, reducing demand inflation and helping maintain the inflation rate within the target of 2-3%.",249

Business and Economics,Economics,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEECERB,VCEEC25EQB7,VCEECERBER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 7b,StudentResponse,The following is an example of a high-scoring response:,"The Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) involves the government issuing carbon credits which allow firms to emit a given volume of CO2. As the government decreases the inelastic supply of carbon credits to meet its environmental objectives, the relative cost of producing carbon-intensive goods and services rises, incentivising resource allocation towards cleaner production methods which are relatively more profitable. In the short term, the ETS may decrease intertemporal efficiency, as the additional costs of production can force inefficient firms to shut down, increasing structural unemployment and thus idle labour resources. This may represent an insufficient quantity of labour resources being allocated towards current production to sustain material living standards through wages, hence representing intertemporal inefficiency. However, in the long term, the ETS should improve intertemporal efficiency by preserving the quantity and quality of natural and common access resources for future generations, ensuring the optimal balance between resources used for current and future production.",265
