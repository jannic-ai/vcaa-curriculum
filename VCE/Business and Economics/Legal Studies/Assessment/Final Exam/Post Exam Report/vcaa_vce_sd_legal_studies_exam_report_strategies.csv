Business and Economics,Legal Studies,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCELSERA,VCELS24EQA1,VCELSERACM,,Question 1a,ExaminerCommentary,"This question required students to give a brief outline of the burden and standard of proof in relation to the stimulus material. To attain full marks, responses needed to correctly identify the burden and standard of proof and link these to the stimulus: for example, stating that the burden of proof is on Louise's client and the standard of proof is on the balance of probabilities.",,1
Business and Economics,Legal Studies,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCELSERA,VCELS24EQA1,VCELSERAER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 1a,StudentResponse,The following is an example of a high-scoring response:,"The burden of proof is the responsibility of the party to prove the facts of the case. In this case the burden of proof is on the clients as they are the plaintiffs who want to sue Louise. The standard of proof is the strength of evidence required to prove the facts of the case. Because the clients want to sue Louise, as it is a civil action and therefore the standard of proof is on the balance of probabilities which means that both parties must provide sufficient evidence to prove that their version of the facts is more probable than not.",2

Business and Economics,Legal Studies,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCELSERA,VCELS24EQA1,VCELSERAER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 1b,StudentResponse,The following is an example of a high-scoring response:,"It may be somewhat appropriate for Louise's clients to initiate a class action against Louise. 22 clients were affected by the matter, which fulfills the criteria of seven or more people affected by the same matter to initiate proceedings against the same party, a class action encompasses. Additionally, they are all equally effected by the matter which would ensure that they are compensated through the damages as all plaintiffs are awarded the same amount of damages. However, one client must be willing to be the lead plaintiff and represent the other clients, including bearing the burden of costs and engaging in legal practitioners and participating in court processes, which may make a class action inappropriate if there is no willing plaintiff.",16
Business and Economics,Legal Studies,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCELSERA,VCELS24EQA2,VCELSERACM,,Question 2,ExaminerCommentary,"This question required students to comprehensively explain a victim impact statement and how it may be considered by a judge when sentencing Jai. Responses needed to effectively address both parts of the question (that is, both what a victim impact statement is and how it may be considered by the judge in sentencing). Students could refer to how the victim impact statement can be either an aggravating or a mitigating factor when sentencing, but full marks could be attained without doing so. If students did raise this point, technical accuracy was not required. In particular, the statement itself is not an aggravating or mitigating factor; rather, it is the circumstance or factor (such as the impact on the victim) that may aggravate or mitigate the offender.",,17

Business and Economics,Legal Studies,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCELSERA,VCELS24EQA2,VCELSERACM,,Question 2,ExaminerCommentary,"A victim impact statement is a written or oral statement presented to the court during the sentencing phase of a criminal trial. It is provided by the primary victim or the primary victim's family to express the emotional, physical and financial impact of the crime on their lives.",,20
Business and Economics,Legal Studies,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCELSERA,VCELS24EQA2,VCELSERACM,,Question 2,ExaminerCommentary,"When sentencing Jai, the court must consider the impact of Jai's offending on Georgia (and possibly other victims such as her family) and her personal circumstances. A victim impact statement allows the judge to understand the impact of Jai attempting to murder Georgia and/or her family, and is a factor that the judge can consider when sentencing Jai.",,21
Business and Economics,Legal Studies,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCELSERA,VCELS24EQA2,VCELSERACM,,Question 2,ExaminerCommentary,"The victim impact statement is one factor to be considered by the judge when sentencing Jai - the impact of which may vary depending on the context and content of the statement. It may emphasise the severity of the harm or trauma Georgia experienced, and demonstrate how the crime has had a lasting impact on her (for example, psychological trauma, physical disabilities and long-term financial struggles). In these instances, the victim impact statement could contribute to the argument for Jai to receive a more severe sentence. It is also possible that Georgia could express forgiveness or a desire for leniency in her victim impact statement.",,22
Business and Economics,Legal Studies,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCELSERA,VCELS24EQA2,VCELSERAER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 2,StudentResponse,The following is an example of a high-scoring response:,"A victim impact statement is a submission made to the court by the victim detailing the extent of any injury, harm or loss suffered as a result of the offender's actions. They are used in sentencing to help the judge gain an understanding about the long-term effects of the offence on the victim, as well as the degree of harm done to the victim. When sentencing Jai, the judge would have considered Georgia's impact statement in order to assess the level of protection Georgia may need from Jai due to seriousness of the harm she has suffered. As this is an attempted murder case it is likely that Georgia will suffer serious long term effects from Jai's actions which may prompt the judge to increase Jai's sentence to correspond to his offending. Thus the statement may be considered as an aggravating factor, as it increases Jai's culpability and may lead to the judge imposing a harsher sentence due to the severe harm caused by Jai's offence.",23
Business and Economics,Legal Studies,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCELSERA,VCELS24EQA3,VCELSERACM,,Question 3a,ExaminerCommentary,"This question required students to outline one reason why the wording of the Australian Constitution may need to be reformed.

Business and Economics,Legal Studies,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCELSERA,VCELS24EQA3,VCELSERACM,,Question 3a,ExaminerCommentary,"Recognition of First Nations peoples - there is currently no mention of First Nations peoples in the Constitution, or recognition of them as the original inhabitants of Australia. There have been calls for changes to the Constitution to give First Nations peoples a voice to parliament (for example, the unsuccessful 2023 referendum) or to recognise them in the preamble",,28
Business and Economics,Legal Studies,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCELSERA,VCELS24EQA3,VCELSERACM,,Question 3a,ExaminerCommentary,"Republicanism - if Australia is to become a republic, the Constitution will need to be changed to require an Australian person, rather than the King, as head of state (for example, the unsuccessful 1999 referendum)",,29
Business and Economics,Legal Studies,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCELSERA,VCELS24EQA3,VCELSERACM,,Question 3a,ExaminerCommentary,"Change to the Commonwealth's law-making powers - if there is a need or desire for the law-making power of the Commonwealth Parliament to change, this can be achieved through constitutional reform. A new situation may arise in which it is best for the Commonwealth Parliament to legislate; this will need to be added to the Commonwealth's specific powers (for example, addition of the social services power in 1946)",,30

Business and Economics,Legal Studies,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCELSERA,VCELS24EQA3,VCELSERAER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 3a,StudentResponse,The following is an example of a high-scoring response:,"One reason why the wording of the Australian Constitution may need to be reformed is to change the division of law-making powers. Since the Constitution limits the powers of the Commonwealth parliament, they could possibly want to expand their law-making powers so that they can make laws on some areas. By passing the Constitutional Alteration Bill and bring a referendum to the people, the Constitution may be able to be reformed.",33
Business and Economics,Legal Studies,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCELSERA,VCELS24EQA3,VCELSERACM,,Question 3b,ExaminerCommentary,"Students were expected to analyse two factors that affected the success of future constitutional reform through the referendum process. The command term 'analyse' requires students to identify components and look at significance, relationships, cause and effect, and impact. Specific language that might support an analysis could include 'Moreover', 'This means that ...', 'This is significant because ...' or 'The impact of this is ...'.",,34

Business and Economics,Legal Studies,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCELSERA,VCELS24EQA3,VCELSERACM,,Question 3b,ExaminerCommentary,"Bipartisan support - the level of support from political parties significantly influences public opinion. Unified support from major parties can increase the likelihood of success, while opposition from one party often leads to divisive campaigns and reduced chances of a 'yes' vote",,41
Business and Economics,Legal Studies,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCELSERA,VCELS24EQA3,VCELSERACM,,Question 3b,ExaminerCommentary,"Clarity of proposal - a clear, simple referendum question is crucial. Complex or confusing proposals often result in voter uncertainty, with many opting to vote 'no' to maintain the status quo.

Business and Economics,Legal Studies,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCELSERA,VCELS24EQA3,VCELSERACM,,Question 3b,ExaminerCommentary,Double majority provision - the requirement for a double majority (more than 50% of voters nationwide and a majority in at least four of six states) makes achieving a 'yes' vote challenging. This stringent provision ensures that only proposals with overwhelming public support succeed.,,43
Business and Economics,Legal Studies,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCELSERA,VCELS24EQA3,VCELSERACM,,Question 3b,ExaminerCommentary,"Additional factors that may have been considered included the conservatism of Australian voters, whether voters are seeking change, and the level of public education about the proposal.",,44
Business and Economics,Legal Studies,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCELSERA,VCELS24EQA3,VCELSERAER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 3b,StudentResponse,The following is an example of a high-scoring response:,"A factor that may affect the success of a referendum is bi partisan support. Bi partisan support regards Australia's political duopoly, in which the country has 2 major political parties. (labour/liberal)",45
Business and Economics,Legal Studies,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCELSERA,VCELS24EQA3,VCELSERAER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 3b,StudentResponse,,"1-way bi partisan support may assist in affecting the success of a referendum is where it is present. This means both major political parties support constitutional reform, therefore members/supporters/those unaffiliated with any party are more inclined in voting in favour of change, thus in turn increasing the likelihood of success of a referendum.",46
Business and Economics,Legal Studies,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCELSERA,VCELS24EQA3,VCELSERAER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 3b,StudentResponse,,"Opposingly where there is a lack of bi partisan support, a referendum is likely to fail. Where 1 major political party opposes constitutional reform a ""no"" campaign is likely to be established, thus influencing members, supporters, those unaffiliated to adopt a conservative approach which may hinder the likelihood of a future referendum in succeeding.",47
Business and Economics,Legal Studies,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCELSERA,VCELS24EQA3,VCELSERAER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 3b,StudentResponse,,"Another factor that may affect the success of constitutional reform is the double majority requirement. Under S128, to change the Australian Constitution requires the approval of the people through a referendum. Where the people disapprove the referendum, proposals are unlikely to satisfy the double majority requirement (majority of yes votes across Australia and a majority of states) in turn leading to an unsuccessful attempt at constitutional reform.",48
Business and Economics,Legal Studies,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCELSERA,VCELS24EQA3,VCELSERACM,,Question 3c,ExaminerCommentary,"This question required students to discuss a way the Australian Constitution acts as a check on the law-making powers of the Commonwealth Parliament, other than the referendum process. A discussion goes beyond an explanation and requires students to consider strengths and weaknesses and to provide a multi-faceted response, which may include phrases such as 'however', 'conversely' or 'on the other hand'. For example, when discussing express protection of rights as a check on law-making powers, students were expected to address the restrictions and limitations of these rights. Responses were expected to focus specifically on how the Constitution limits the Commonwealth Parliament's law-making powers (not those of state parliaments) and address one of the three key means outlined in the study design:",,49

Business and Economics,Legal Studies,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCELSERA,VCELS24EQA3,VCELSERACM,,Question 3c,ExaminerCommentary,Responses may have included the following points:,,54
Business and Economics,Legal Studies,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCELSERA,VCELS24EQA3,VCELSERACM,,Question 3c,ExaminerCommentary,"A 'check' on law-making powers refers to process, devices or sections of the Constitution that limit the Parliament's ability to pass legislation in certain areas, so that the Parliament does not have supreme law-making powers.",,55
Business and Economics,Legal Studies,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCELSERA,VCELS24EQA3,VCELSERACM,,Question 3c,ExaminerCommentary,"The express protection of rights - students needed to explain how express rights in the Constitution act as a check on Parliament's law-making. The Constitution contains five express rights, each explicitly limiting the Commonwealth Parliament's powers in specific areas. For example, section 116 prohibits laws that establish a religion or interfere with religious freedom, thus acting as a check on Parliament's law-making power in this area. However, the limited number and narrow scope of express rights means the restrictions on Parliament's powers are also limited.",,56
Business and Economics,Legal Studies,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCELSERA,VCELS24EQA3,VCELSERACM,,Question 3c,ExaminerCommentary,"The separation of powers ensures that legislative, executive and judicial powers are held by different branches of government, preventing the concentration of power. This helps protect against abuses of power, as no single branch can control law-making. However, the executive and legislative branches are intertwined in practice, as Cabinet members, who hold executive power, are also members of Parliament, limiting the effectiveness of the separation of powers as a check.",,57

Representative government refers to the situation whereby the people elect members of parliament to represent them. This is enshrined in the Constitution through sections 7 and 24 of the Constitution, which guarantee that members of Parliament are directly chosen by the people. The High Court can invalidate laws that infringe upon voters' rights, as seen in Roach v Electoral Commissioner, where the High Court ruled that the Commonwealth Parliament can only restrict the right of people to vote for a substantial reason. The High Court has also recognised an implied right to political communication, acting as a check on laws that limit free political discourse.",,58

Business and Economics,Legal Studies,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCELSERA,VCELS24EQA3,VCELSERAER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 3c,StudentResponse,,"The Australian Constitution acts as a check on Commonwealth Parliament in law making through the separation of powers. This principle divides the responsibilities into three distinct categories, thus checking the legislative branch of Commonwealth Parliament through the independent judiciary and executive. This is evident with the judiciary holding the power to interpret legislative principles through application ensuring that Parliament remain within their law making powers. This may occur through the protection of express rights, such as the freedom of religion in s116 as the courts can rule Parliament to have violated their abilities ruling the act ultra vires. However the separation of powers is limited through the overlap of branches, with the Prime Minister and cabinet members sitting in both the legislature and executive arms.

Jurors are permitted to take notes to help them make sense of the evidence, especially where conflicting evidence may have been presented.

Jurors are people randomly selected from the electoral roll who must put aside any preconceived ideas and ensure that they have no connection with either party. Moreover as part of their role to be objective, a jury must ensure all decisions are based on fact and not their own research which may instil them with a prejudice. Indeed jurors are independent of parties and do not take sides thereby fulfilling their role of being objective. However, jurors may have subconscious biases or not comply with obligations which can impede on their objectivity.

One such source is international treaties. In this case, the Australian government had signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (the Paris Agreement). Once a treaty has been signed by Parliament it is expected that the government will introduce legislation to ratify and incorporate the terms of the treaty into domestic law. In this case, it would place political pressure on Parliament to change laws relating to zero and low emission vehicles. The impact of this is seen in Source 2, where Parliament has continued to amend laws related to low emission vehicles. Although the result of Parliament adopting the National Electric Vehicle Strategy may be a result of domestic campaigns and other pressures, not just international pressures.",48

Firstly, exclusive powers which are outlined under Section 51 and 52 of the Constitution are afforded only to the Commonwealth (Cwth) Parliament meaning only they can legislate on these areas, and the states can't.

Judicial conservatism refers to when judges interpret the law relatively narrowly, generally speaking to avoid making changes to the law and uphold previous laws. Though Justice Gordon argued the majority ruling ""amends the Constitution"" (suggesting judicial activism by changing the meaning) this case is an example of judicial conservatism. For example by declaring the tax imposed by the legislation as invalid, the High Court referred the continuing of the Zero Low Emission Vehicle Distance Based Charge Act 2021 (Vic) as they deemed the consumption tax is an excise. Hence this avoids legislation being made and developed, as the new Act has faced amendments. Thus by avoiding new legislation, the justices (4 of them) acted mainly conservatively.",72

Parliament can pass legislation to establish courts, or change their jurisdiction, to restrict their decision-making in some instances, thereby impacting the law-making power of courts. However, under the doctrine of the separation of powers, courts need to remain independent from parliament. This is important in situations where a court (for example, High Court) needs to determine whether parliament has the power to make laws in a particular area.",,108
Business and Economics,Legal Studies,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCELSERA,VCELS25EQA5,VCELSERAER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 5,ExaminerCommentary,"The ability of courts to influence parliament: Judges may influence parliament to change laws either through the comments made during a case or the decisions they make. In making a judgement in a case, a judge may make a comment (either in their ratio decidendi, or as obiter dicta) that can subsequently influence parliament to make or change a related law. 
Similarly, if a judge is bound to follow precedent set by a higher court and that results in a decision deemed to be unjust, parliament may be influenced to make a legislative change - which parliament is able to do due to its supremacy.
If there is no legislation to apply to a particular case, or the legislation is silent on an issue/aspect, the court may decide to create a law through precedent. This may influence the parliament to pass legislation in that area.  
However, courts can only create common law when a case is brought before them, which limits their ability to influence parliament through judicial comments or decisions.",,109

Business and Economics,Legal Studies,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCELSERA,VCELS25EQA5,VCELSERAER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 5,StudentResponse,,"Because Parliament is the supreme law-making body, it results in them being able to legislate in many areas of law within their jurisdiction (they are unable to legislate on Constitutional matters as these must be left to the High Court). This means that Parliament is responsible for making laws that give the courts jurisdiction on the cases that they can hear, this is significant because Parliament can determine the court's role and ability to hear cases. This is evident as Parliament passed the Magistrates Court Act and as a result the Magistrates Court can only hear cases the Act outlines.

Business and Economics,Legal Studies,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCELSERB,VCELS25EQB2,VCELSERBER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 2d,StudentResponse,,"One weakness that will impact whether parliament can reform laws is if there is a hostile upper house. A hostile upper house refers to when parliament does not hold the majority of seats in the Senate and will require support from minor parties to pass legislation. The Government did not have the majority of seats in the Senate and the Greens held the balance of power holding 11 seats. This means that if the government wishes to legislate to change ""move on"" principles they would require support from the minor parties or coalition to pass laws. This negatively impacts law making because it means the government would potentially need to incorporate the desires and views of the Greens party so that they can pass legislation.",121
