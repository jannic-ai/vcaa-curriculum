Business and Economics,Legal Studies,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCELSER,VCELSERGC,General Comments,,"In general, students demonstrated a good understanding of key legal concepts and command terms in the 2024 VCE Legal Studies examination, effectively responding to terms such as 'outline', 'explain' and 'to what extent'. Many students were able to use paragraphs, where appropriate, as well as key words to signpost responses. For example, when responding to 'analyse' questions, students used phrases such as 'moreover' and 'this can be seen' to transition from explanation to analysis. Additionally, students demonstrated a good understanding of foundational concepts such as burden and standard of proof, the rights of the accused and class actions.",,0

Business and Economics,Legal Studies,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCELSER,VCELSERGC,General Comments,,"carefully reading questions to fully understand their scope and limitations. For example, in Section A Question 3b., students were required to analyse two factors that may affect the success of future constitutional reform through the referendum process. While responses identified relevant factors, many did not link these to the success of future constitutional reform",,3
Business and Economics,Legal Studies,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCELSER,VCELSERGC,General Comments,,"accurately addressing the specific command term within each question. For example, responses to Question 3c. often explained how the Australian Constitution acts as a check on the law-making powers of the Commonwealth Parliament rather than discussing the necessary points",,4
Business and Economics,Legal Studies,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCELSER,VCELSERGC,General Comments,,"avoiding inclusion of unnecessary definitions that are not explicitly required by the question. Where needed, definitions should be incorporated implicitly into responses rather than rote learned and included in a separate paragraph",,5

Business and Economics,Legal Studies,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCELSER,VCELSERGC,General Comments,,"providing the specified number of reasons, differences or features asked for in the question, and ensuring these are clearly identified in the response.

For instance, examples or evidence could have been used to enhance responses to Section A Question 3a. (reasons for constitutional reform) and Question 3c. (checks on the law-making powers of the Commonwealth Parliament).",,9
Business and Economics,Legal Studies,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCELSER,VCELSERGC,General Comments,,"Additionally, examination techniques that could improve student responses include ensuring handwriting is clear and legible, using blue or black pen for readability, and correctly labelling responses. The examination is scanned and marked electronically, and it is therefore important that students write 'PTO', 'see extra space' or similar to direct assessors to continued responses where necessary. Moreover, structuring responses with well-organised paragraphs and clear transitions helps to ensure clarity and alignment with the requirements of the question. For example, when analysing two factors, each factor should be addressed in a separate paragraph, with use of analytic language to support the response.",,10

Business and Economics,Legal Studies,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCELSER,VCELSERGC,General Comments,,"To avoid any consequent disadvantage for other students, the Panel recommended that those students were removed from the standard study score, including the distribution of study scores.
