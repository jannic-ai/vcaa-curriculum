County Court. It was alleged that Luke failed to comply with the trial judge's direction to the jury to not
conduct their own enquiries about the case or the accused.
Despite warnings from judges, there have been several instances of jurors undertaking independent
research. When this occurs, a jury is discharged. Failure to follow a direction of the judge is classified as
contempt of court - an indictable offence.
Luke pleaded not guilty to his contempt of court charge, which will be heard summarily in the
Court. His defence lawyer submitted that her client thought the judge's direction to
not conduct enquiries was limited to factual matters related to the crime itself and did not extend to
legal enquiries about things such as legal terminology, and therefore Luke did not possess criminal
intent. Luke was convicted in the Magistrates' Court and fined 120 penalty units, equating to a fine of
approximately $23 000. Luke has lodged an appeal.

world, including in Australia. In 2016, the Australian Government ratified the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (The Paris Agreement). As part of this commitment, the Australian
Government has adopted the National Electric Vehicle Strategy, to reduce emissions and increase the
uptake of electric vehicles.
'emissions - substances such as gas or fumes sent out into the air

Some Victorians have expressed concerns about the increased use of electric vehicles. As one
commentator has suggested:
While a shift to electric vehicles will deliver many environmental and health benefits,
they .. still drive on roads. It is only right then that electric vehicles make a fair
contribution to pay for the roads they rely on - similar to that paid by petrol and diesel
vehicle owners.

In July 2021, the Victorian Parliament passed the Zero and Low Emission Vehicle Distance-based
Charge Act 2021 (Vic). This Act required registered owners of electric and hybrid vehicles to record
the number of kilometres travelled each year on public roads and report it to VicRoads. Owners S,
were then charged per kilometre travelled.
The Hon. Tim Pallas, in his second reading speech to Parliament in the Legislative Assembly, :
explained the reason for the charge:
Most Australian drivers pay fuel excise? when they fill up their vehicle with
petrol, diesel or liquified petroleum gas (LPG). Fuel excise is an important @
. L .
source of revenue that contributes to building and maintaining our roads as
the Commonwealth redistributes some of this revenue to state and territory
governments ..
EVs [electric vehicles] . . do not contribute to the costs of [the] road network ..
ZLEV [zero and low emission vehicle] owners pay little or no fuel excise, but
they still use the roads.
The reforms introduced in this Bill ensure all motorists contribute their fair share
to the cost of funding Victorian roads ..

2excise - a tax levied on certain goods and commodities produced or sold within a country
Source
In the case of Vanderstock v Victoria [2023] HCA 30, Chris Vanderstock and Kathleen Davies
launched a High Court challenge against the State of Victoria. The plaintiffs were financially
supported by the Commonwealth Government in their action. The defendant was joined by each of
the state and territory governments.
The plaintiffs argued that the Victorian Parliament did not have the constitutional authority to
impose an 'excise' on ZLEV drivers for using public roads, as charged in the Zero and Low
Emission Vehicle Distance-based Charge Act 2021 (Vic). They argued that section 90 of the
Australian Constitution states that the power to impose duties of excise is an exclusive power of the
Commonwealth Parliament.
The defendants argued that the Victorian legislation was not an 'excise', but rather
tax', based on the use of public roads. They argued that the High Court had, in numerous cases
over the decades, ruled that a consumption tax is not an excise.
In October 2023, in a majority (4:3) decision, the High Court ruled in favour of the plaintif s, and
declared the tax imposed by the legislation to be invalid because it was an excise. In a separate
dissenting judgement, Justice Gordon declared 'Constitutionally, | cannot agree ... because it is
not construing the text of the Constitution; instead, it amends the Constitution and .. [gives] to the
Commonwealth an exclusive unbounded class of taxation . . For many decades, this Court has
held that a tax on the use of goods - a usage consumption tax - is not a duty of excise ...'

Emma rented a property in Valley Springs. Following a report to police from a member of the public,
the property was placed under surveillance by the police.
During the surveillance operation, it was noted that there was an unusual pattern and frequency of
visitors to the property - all of which was recorded.
Police obtained and executed a search warrant on the property, where they found more than 300
cannabis plants at various stages of maturity. Emma had made modifications to the rear of the
property to enable the plants to be cultivated and processed for sale.
Emma was arrested and taken to the Valley Springs Police Station for questioning. She received
an official police caution. Emma had studied Legal Studies at school and remembered some of
the terminology. She was aware of something called 'the presumption of innocence' and chose to
exercise her right to silence.
Emma was charged with category 2 offences - cultivating a commercial quantity of drugs and
trafficking a commercial quantity of drugs. She was found guilty of both offences in the County Court
and is awaiting sentence. For category 2 offences, courts must impose a sentence of imprisonment
if the offender was aged 18 or over when they committed the offence, unless the offender has
impaired mental functioning or has assisted the authorities.
All of Emma's assets were seized as the proceeds of crime.
Source
Agu and Kim, the owners of the property where Emma was carrying out her illegal drug operation,
were devastated. As victims of crime, they consulted a community legal centre (CLC) to find out
what rights they would have in the criminal case against Emma, and to seek general advice in
relation to a possible civil claim.
Agu and Kim filed an insurance claim with their insurer; however, the company has since cancelled
their policy and denied their claim due to the following clause in their contract:
'The insurer reserves the right to cancel this policy immediately if the insured or
any person occupying the insured property is found to be involved in illegal activity.
Furthermore, the insurer will not be liable to pay for any loss, damage or liability arising
directly or indirectly from activities deemed illegal under the law
Agu and Kim have been advised that due to extensive damage caused by Emma's modifications,
the house will need to be demolished. They are considering suing Emma for losses they have
suffered due to her illegal activities, including the cost of demolishing and rebuilding their property,
and the loss of rental income.

assemble peacefully - that is, to gather for a common purpose, such as to protest or meet.
Under section 6 of the Summary Offences Act 1966 (Vic), police and protective service officers have
the power to direct a person in a public place to 'move on' or leave the public place, but only in limited
circumstances. This power to 'move on' does not apply in relation to a person who is demonstrating or
protesting in public.
Recently, individuals and groups have called for greater control over the way in which demonstrations
are conducted.
Source
In a radio interview on 3AW with broadcaster Tom Elliott, Victorian Leader of the Opposition Brad
Battin called for the reintroduction of more extensive move-on laws, which were repealed by the
Andrews government in 2015. These laws would allow Victoria Police to move protestors on if they are
obstructing public access or causing a public nuisance. The following is an extract of the transcript of
the interview.
Tom Elliott: 	 Will you impose, perhaps, a permit system or some way of limiting protests so we
don't have to have 80 of them in a row?
Brad Battin: 	I think the most important thing here is to reintroduce our move-on laws and maybe
toughen them as well. But the focus needs to be that if someone wants to go to work,
go into a business legally, go about their normal day, then they shouldn't be disrupted
by protestors. And that includes driving down a road. Move-on laws can be put back
in place to fix that. If you start to make people get out of the way for people going
about their legal duties, then those protestors will have nowhere to protest for that.
Give them a right to protest, but they don't need to block everyone going about their
legal duties ... Let's make sure the police have the powers to move people on. That
will clear the streets, get people out of the way, and let you get back around your
normal day.

before this month's local government elections. 'I also recognise that after 52 weeks of protests, the
disruption is significant. I am particularly worried about small businesses in the city which rely on
weekend trade to make ends meet.'

Online letter to the editor
The Victorian Chamber of Commerce has called for a specific space for protest activities that would
not impede on allowing small businesses to trade. I think this is a fantastic idea. It would serve the
interests of both the community and the protesters. While I am sympathetic to the cause of many of
these protests, I am sick and tired of the impact on my daily commute. And if I know there is going to
be a protest in the city, I will avoid going in, which I know affects small-business owners.
