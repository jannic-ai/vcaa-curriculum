Business and Economics,Accounting,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEACER,VCEACERGC,General Comments,,"Most students were able to complete the examination within the 2 hours allocated. While some students did not attempt every question, this appeared to be due to their knowledge of particular topics rather than running out of time, as they missed questions intermittently throughout the examination. It is important that students cover all areas of the VCE Accounting Study Design throughout the course, as all areas are eligible for assessment in the examination.",,2
Business and Economics,Accounting,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEACER,VCEACERGC,General Comments,,"Effective use of reading time is a skill that should be practised throughout the year. It is important that students ensure that they read each question thoroughly and highlight the key parts of the question before attempting a response. Many students appeared to have misread questions, resulting in inaccurate responses that did not directly address the requirements of the question.",,3
Business and Economics,Accounting,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEACER,VCEACERGC,General Comments,,"Terminology is a significant component of the VCE Accounting Study Design. Students should gain, and be able to apply, an understanding of all terminology covered within the course, not just the regularly used terms. When responding to theory questions, students should ensure that they support their responses with terminology, in particular terminology that appears in the Study Design. Correct terms need to be used when describing the change in financial indicators.",,4

Business and Economics,Accounting,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEACER,VCEACERGC,General Comments,,"Higher-scoring responses explained how credit notes can be used as a non-financial indicator of business performance by referring to the number of credit notes representing the number of sales returns received by the business. They were able to refer to a higher number of sales returns indicating a negative customer satisfaction (or a lower number representing positive customer satisfaction). As the question did not refer to sales returns, it was possible for higher-scoring responses to take the approach that a higher level of purchase returns indicated a potential issue with the inventory management of the business.",,16
Business and Economics,Accounting,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEACER,VCEACERGC,General Comments,,"Common errors included referring to financial indicators such as an increase in the value of sales returns.

Business and Economics,Accounting,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEACER,VCEACERGC,General Comments,,The following is an example of a high-scoring student response.,,18
Business and Economics,Accounting,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEACER,VCEACERGC,General Comments,,Credit notes verify sales returns so the volume of credit note indicates the number of sales returns. The number of sales returns is a non financial indicator and provides the business with feedback of how satisfied customers where with the inventory in terms of its quality and function. So if there are many credit notes issued by the business it indicates customers are unhappy with the product and aids in decision making such as improving the quality of inventory which can improve performance.,,19

Business and Economics,Accounting,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEACER,VCEACERGC,General Comments,,"Common errors included not indicating that the reason would result in an inventory loss being incurred, such as referring to recording errors while not referring to how they would result in an inventory loss. Referring to damage or wastage would not result in an inventory loss if the business recorded the impact on the inventory at the time that they occurred.

Business and Economics,Accounting,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEACER,VCEACERGC,General Comments,,"Individual items, such as those that are higher in value, can be security tagged and coded. This allows for staff to be immediately alerted if items are stolen, and gives them the ability to track the inventory as well. This security technology will assist in regaining stolen items, ensuring that the inventory loss does not result from theft, while also discouraging individuals from considering stealing items, so that the risk of theft is fully avoided.",,60
Business and Economics,Accounting,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEACER,VCEACERGC,General Comments,,"Teachers should ensure that students provide a description when the question requires it, rather than simply identifying an internal control.",,61
Business and Economics,Accounting,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEACER,VCEACERGC,General Comments,,This question required students to analyse the likely effects on business performance of having an inventory turnover that is much slower than the industry average.,,62
Business and Economics,Accounting,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEACER,VCEACERGC,General Comments,,"Higher-scoring responses referred to the slower inventory turnover being due to the business holding inventory for longer than other pet food stores. The business could have a larger range than its competitors which could result in liquidity issues, as the inventory turnover of 90 days is likely to be beyond credit terms which are usually around 30 days. This will result in the business paying for inventory before cash is received from customers. The slower inventory turnover could be an indication of less sales than competitors, which could impact the ability of the business to generate the cash required to pay expenses such as wages and rent.",,63
Business and Economics,Accounting,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEACER,VCEACERGC,General Comments,,"The potentially wider range of inventory could result in issues with inventory management. The business expects that the inventory loss will be significantly higher than competitors, and a slower inventory turnover could result in an inventory write-down as the pet food approaches its use-by date.",,64
Business and Economics,Accounting,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEACER,VCEACERGC,General Comments,,There could also be additional insurance and storage costs incurred by the business while holding the inventory.,,65
Business and Economics,Accounting,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEACER,VCEACERGC,General Comments,,The following is an example of a high-scoring student response.,,66
Business and Economics,Accounting,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEACER,VCEACERGC,General Comments,,"Having a much slower ITO suggests the firm is taking much longer than its competitors to produce inventory into sales. This could cause liquidity problems as the firm might not be producing enough sales to meet its short-term debts such as wages and rent. Furthermore, it puts pressure on the cash cycle of the firm and further worsens liquidity due to the lack of cash to pay its Accounts Payable. Moreover, a slower ITO also suggests more inventory is on hand for the firm than other firms. Given the edible nature of inventory, it is more susceptible to expire and likely get written down or lost hence increasing the inventory loss and write-down expenses of the firm. This decreases profit and the ability to generate profits against the firm's expenses. Hence worsening profitability.",,67
Business and Economics,Accounting,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEACER,VCEACERGC,General Comments,,"This question required students to justify the accountant's suggestion that a change to the First In, First Out (FIFO) inventory cost assignment method would improve efficiency.",,68
Business and Economics,Accounting,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEACER,VCEACERGC,General Comments,,One mark was awarded for referring to labelling all inventory items if using the Identified Cost assignment method would be a time-consuming and inefficient process for a pet food business.,,69
Business and Economics,Accounting,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEACER,VCEACERGC,General Comments,,One mark was awarded for referring to the FIFO cost assignment method as more efficient and less time consuming as it only requires the details of each product from barcode readers for inventory records to be updated.,,70
Business and Economics,Accounting,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEACER,VCEACERGC,General Comments,,"One mark was awarded for the overall effect on inventory being the same, as pet food would be sold on a regular basis regardless of which method was used.",,71
Business and Economics,Accounting,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEACER,VCEACERGC,General Comments,,"Higher-scoring responses recognised that the costs of labelling each individual item may not be considered important for a business that sells pet food. The inventory is likely to consist of low cost, high turnover goods and the additional cost of labelling would not be offset by any benefits.",,72
Business and Economics,Accounting,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEACER,VCEACERGC,General Comments,,"Common errors included referring to the benefits of selling the oldest inventory first as this would be less likely to go out of date. Students did not recognise that the FIFO cost assignment method is an assumption and does not refer to the actual movement of inventory in the business. Other students referred to the benefits of not incurring the costs of labelling inventory, although they did not apply their response to a pet food store.",,73
Business and Economics,Accounting,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEACER,VCEACERGC,General Comments,,The following is an example of a high-scoring student response.,,74
Business and Economics,Accounting,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEACER,VCEACERGC,General Comments,,"First-in, first-out (FIFO) refers to the assumption that the first inventory in is the first likely sold by the firm, whereas identified cost labels and bags each invoice to determine cost price of sale.",,75
Business and Economics,Accounting,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEACER,VCEACERGC,General Comments,,"Given the nature of the inventory to be food, it would be very time-consuming to classify inventory by its cost price. Further, it will cost the firm more to spend wages in the process.",,76
Business and Economics,Accounting,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2025,,VCEACER,VCEACERGC,General Comments,,"By using first-in, first-out, the firm tends to be more time-efficient and cost-efficient.
