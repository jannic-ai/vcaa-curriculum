Business and Economics,Accounting,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEACER,VCEAC24EQ1,VCEACERER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 1c,StudentResponse,The following is an example of a high-scoring student response:,"Using identified cost, items of inventory are tagged and coded so the cost price of inventory that is being sold and received (e.g. sales returns) is accurately known, enabling accurate figure of cost of sales to be determined leading to an accurate net profit as well as the inventory value in the balance sheet. However this method is time-consuming and expensive and is typically used for slower-moving inventory of higher cost prices. As the make-up and wigs are lower priced, Blozzo Bazaar uses FIFO likely as the additional cost incurred by identified cost outweigh the benefit of more accurate reports. Additionally due to the lower cost impact of using FIFO which assumes the first inventory received is the first to sell, would not be as significant on the accuracy of cost of goods sold and net profit. Hence, the business likely uses different methods based on the nature of inventory and speed of inventory turnover.",35

Business and Economics,Accounting,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEACER,VCEAC24EQ2,VCEACERER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 2a,ExaminerCommentary,"There was a decline in sales in 2024, possibly due to a loss of reputation and repeat business from regular customers. The trend of increasing sales returns and declining customer satisfaction continued and does not augur well for future sales. Brand loyalty has likely been damaged by retaining the Me4 logo on what the company knows are inferior inventory, which is questionable ethically as customers have not been made aware of the lower quality.",,42
Business and Economics,Accounting,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEACER,VCEAC24EQ2,VCEACERER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 2a,ExaminerCommentary,"The business may consider using a 'second' brand to distinguish the new products and retain some of the inventory from the old supplier, even if it has to increase the mark-up to maintain profitability. Repeat customers generally value quality and will move to competitors if necessary. Buying in larger quantities has also led to a build-up of inventory, as shown by the slower inventory turnover. This could lead to obsolescence, decline in return on assets or future discounting to clear inventory.",,43
Business and Economics,Accounting,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEACER,VCEAC24EQ2,VCEACERER,EnhancedStrategies,Question 2a,ExaminerCommentary,The increased Net Profit Margin could be due to the business improving its expense control by reducing sales and service staff.,,44

As the delivery cost of $3 000 for Me4Camping included three different items, the $3 000 may not be logically allocated to each item as it can't be assumed that each item would incur the same delivery cost.

Other options (such as selling a vehicle) provide a short-term fix to liquidity issues; however, reviewing how the business deals with accounts receivable can provide ongoing benefits. This may be through sending invoices more quickly or sending reminder notices. By reviewing how Patio follows up their accounts receivable, there should be consistent improvements in liquidity though a quicker ARTO, given that any problems are acted upon, which is necessary for this business given they sell on credit, so receipts from accounts receivable are likely to be the main source of cash inflows.",138

This is unlikely to improve liquidity - since all sales are on credit, sales revenue might increase but it risks losing sales as mark-up is increased, and doesn't address cash collection from credit customers that would improve liquidity.

The business could have a larger range than its competitors which could result in liquidity issues, as the inventory turnover of 90 days is likely to be beyond credit terms which are usually around 30 days. This will result in the business paying for inventory before cash is received from customers.

This could cause liquidity problems as the firm might not be producing enough sales to meet its short-term debts such as wages and rent. Furthermore, it puts pressure on the cash cycle of the firm and further worsens liquidity due to the lack of cash to pay its Accounts Payable. Moreover, a slower ITO also suggests more inventory is on hand for the firm than other firms. Given the edible nature of inventory, it is more susceptible to expire and likely get written down or lost hence increasing the inventory loss and write-down expenses of the firm. This decreases profit and the ability to generate profits against the firm's expenses. Hence worsening profitability.",64
