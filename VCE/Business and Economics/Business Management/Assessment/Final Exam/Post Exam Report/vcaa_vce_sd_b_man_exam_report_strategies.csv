Business and Economics,Business Management,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEBMERA,VCEBM24EQA1,VCEBMERALR,LimitedStrategies,Question 1a,ExaminerCommentary,"The key elements in the operations system are inputs, processes and outputs. Some responses did not name an element, while others did not adequately describe the element selected. When applying the 'process' element, responses often focused on the new technology as a process rather than recognising that technology is an input. When using technology as a process, the focus must be on what the technology is doing. To describe a process, students are encouraged to use verbs. For Sammah's Foodz, verbs such as mixing, cutting, packaging and freezing are examples that describe acceptable processes. Responses that focused on outputs were generally strong, providing both a general explanation of outputs and a specific application to the business output (frozen savoury food).",,2

Some inputs at Samaah's Foodz include the ingredients used to make the savoury foods that are frozen, as well as the freezers used to freeze and store the product.

The low-risk strategies for change identified in the study design include communication, empowerment, support and incentives. Training and counselling were also considered appropriate strategies. A high-scoring response needed to explain how the selected strategy could be used to reduce employee resistance to change at Sammah's Foodz (either the introduction of new technology or reduction of waste).",,4

In this case, they were required to clearly explain how the chosen strategy would reduce resistance to change at Sammah's Foodz.

The communication of this change should openly and honestly outline the reasons and benefits for changing, including to achieve the new goals of broadening products and reducing waste, as well as communicating consequences of not changing. By allowing employees to clearly understand the reasons for change in order to remain competitive, they are more likely to accept the change and thus employee resistance can be overcome.",7

By identifying areas of their production process that do not add value, such as excess packaging around their frozen goods, they could begin only purchasing the minimum necessary packaging, thereby reducing that wastage that results when customers throw this material away.",12

For example, they could develop a system in which customers return the packaging from their products in return for discounts. Sammah's could then reuse this packaging again and reduce its wastage.",13

Moreover, another advantage of Porter's differentiation strategy for Sammah's Foodz is that they will be able to attract a more loyal customer base whereby customers can only buy those products from them.

Furthermore, another disadvantage of Porter's differentiation strategy for Sammah's Foodz is that it may not be hard for other competing businesses to also introduce the products Sammah's stocks, which could therefore lead to decreased sales.",25

At Surf n' Stuff they would be able to use computer aided design to create different swimwear products and new surfboard shapes using technology. This would be able to design boards with correct sizing and volume. Such as it may be able to create a longboard with the height of 9,2 and the correct volume and dimensions all through the use of technology. This then allows them to see whether this board will look good and whether it needs to be produced Rather than simply producing it and then realising it is not a good product which would be extremely inefficient. Instead using computer aided design will benefit Surf n' Stuff even potentially allowing for individual customer orders to be created online. Which they can then show to customers what their board will look like to ensure the utmost level of satisfaction. As efficiency is the ability to increase outputs with the same or less inputs. The use of computer aided design will reduce inputs in the production process as less is wasted due to being able to pre check designs online rather than producing them and hoping they are up to standard. This then lowers inputs and can even save time for the same amount of outputs. Thus, increasing their efficiency as a result.",55

For example, managers will understand that they will just have to unfreeze, explaining to employees why the closure of stores is necessary to ensuring business success in online spaces. Another benefit of using the Three-step Change Model is that it ensures a change can be embedded within the culture, policies and activities of a business into the future.

For example, employees have been given on-the-job training to ensure that they know how to use the equipment. The AI function in the registers links directly to gates that allow the customer to exit the store. Employees need to know how to respond if the gates fail to open; in some cases it may indicate that the customer is attempting to steal an item, but in other cases it might mean that there has been an error in the analysis process.",94

Although the task of scanning items and placing them in bags is no longer done by staff members, the employees will still need to be aware of customers who need assistance. For example, the managers at Coles might decide to use performance related pay for those employees who proactively assist a certain number of customers each day. Alternatively they might use this process to identify young employees who are keen to progress their career at the supermarket. This could help to ensure that any future money that is spent on training is directed appropriately.",95

For example, employee observation at the checkouts will make it possible for the managers at Coles to see whether or not the employees are using the signals provided by the artificial intelligence appropriately. Doing this will ultimately reduce the number of items lost to theft. With lower losses due to this outcome, the total expense for inventory losses will be reduced.

It has unfavourably decreased from over 8000 in July 2023 to under 3000 in June 2024. Likewise, the percentage of market share has unfavourably decreased from around 12% to 8%. Percentage of market share refers to the amount of overall sales controlled by Soaring Rox in the rock climbing industry in relation to competitors, expressed as a percentage over a given time period. This indicates that Soaring Rox's website is difficult to use or has bugs that need to be fixed, which reduces the number of customers that book rock climbing experiences, thus decreasing their customer sales and bookings in relation to other rock climbing centres in the city, thus decreasing their percentage of market share.",8

As Soaring Rox is facing a crisis of decreasing market share in the rock climbing industry, as she is using centralised decision making and is making business decisions herself without needing to consult opinions for employees, such as the decision to replace the first-aid room, this can ensure change occurs swiftly. Additionally another benefit is that Mia can clearly communicate to employees about the changes made at Soaring Rox, which can ensure change occurs exactly as intended.
