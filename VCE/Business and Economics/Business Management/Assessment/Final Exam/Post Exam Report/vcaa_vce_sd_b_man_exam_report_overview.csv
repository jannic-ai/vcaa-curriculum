Business and Economics,Business Management,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEBMER,VCEBMERGC,General Comments,,"In general, students performed well in the 2024 VCE Business Management examination, with the majority of students attempting all questions. Students are reminded that they are expected to apply their understanding and skill set to the case studies and scenarios provided in order to achieve higher marks, rather than simply relying on memorised content.",,0
Business and Economics,Business Management,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEBMER,VCEBMERGC,General Comments,,"Definitions: There appears to be some confusion about when it is appropriate to provide a definition in a response. Marks will not be awarded for definitions that are not specifically required, as indicated by the wording of a question. For example, in Section B, there was no need to define 'on-the-job training' when responding to Question 6, nor was there a need to define 'autocratic management style' when responding to Question 4. Likewise, in Section A, definitions of 'low risk strategy' (Question 1b.) and 'corporate social responsibility' (Question 3a.) were not required. Students can demonstrate an understanding of the term implicitly within their response; an explicit definition is not required. To clarify, it is expected that a definition will be included when:",,1
Business and Economics,Business Management,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEBMER,VCEBMERGC,General Comments,,the command term is 'define',,2
Business and Economics,Business Management,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEBMER,VCEBMERGC,General Comments,,"subsequent sections of the response require the student to show how aspects of a definition have been applied (for example, Section B Question 1)",,3
Business and Economics,Business Management,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEBMER,VCEBMERGC,General Comments,,distinguishing between or comparing two terms (but only when using the definitions to highlight similarities or differences that exist).,,4
Business and Economics,Business Management,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEBMER,VCEBMERGC,General Comments,,"Time management: The majority of students were able to provide a response to all questions within the examination. Students are reminded, however, that effective time management is crucial. It is important that they avoid spending too long writing overly detailed responses to questions with a low mark allocation, as this may leave insufficient time to address questions with higher mark allocations (such as Section A Question 4, worth 10 marks). Students are encouraged to maintain a steady pace throughout the exam in order to avoid leaving responses unanswered towards the end. Practising timed exams will assist students in developing the skills required to complete all sections thoroughly within the allotted two hours of writing time.",,5
Business and Economics,Business Management,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEBMER,VCEBMERGC,General Comments,,"Command terms: The overall accuracy of responses suggests that students are comfortable with the majority of commonly used command terms. It is clear that students have worked with the glossary of command terms and are applying their understanding accurately. For example, students responded accurately to commonly used command terms such as 'discuss' and 'compare'. Students are reminded that command terms used less frequently in past examinations may be used in the future. It was notable in the 2024 examination that students did not respond as well to command terms 'analyse', 'interpret' and 'justify'.",,6
Business and Economics,Business Management,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEBMER,VCEBMERGC,General Comments,,The study design: The study design is a useful tool for indicating the language and terminology students are required to use in order to demonstrate their learning. A strong understanding of the study's terminology will empower students to use these terms accurately.,,7
Business and Economics,Business Management,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEBMER,VCEBMERGC,General Comments,,It was evident in some responses that many students were reproducing pre-learned material verbatim. Students are reminded that there are no definitions that require a specific sequence of words to be used; marks are awarded based on the depth of understanding that is shown and the ability to apply key knowledge and key skills in a way that is relevant and accurate.,,8
Business and Economics,Business Management,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEBMER,VCEBMERGC,General Comments,,"Many students appeared to have memorised intricate details of contemporary case studies covered in class. These details were often outside the scope of the task and did not accurately address the question being asked. For example, Section A Question 4 required students to discuss strategies for managing human resources in the context of a contemporary case study. A significant number of responses focused on change management rather than human resource management. Similarly, Section A Question 3c. required students to justify the use of a specific theory, but many responses instead described the process of applying the theory, which did not fully address the requirements of the question.",,9
Business and Economics,Business Management,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEBMER,VCEBMERGC,General Comments,,"In 2024, 65 examinations were potentially impacted by the early publication of the examination material. After extensive analysis, only 5 exams were found to have been impacted. The Business Management examination was one of those 5 examinations.",,10

Business and Economics,Business Management,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEBMER,VCEBMERGC,General Comments,,The statistical analysis revealed anomalies in the data where a small number of students performed significantly better on the impacted questions compared to their performance in the rest of the paper.,,14
Business and Economics,Business Management,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEBMER,VCEBMERGC,General Comments,,"To avoid any consequent disadvantage for other students, the Panel recommended that those students were removed from the standard study score, including the distribution of study scores. The scores of impacted students were then inserted into the overall distribution at a matched point after the study scores had been distributed.",,15
Business and Economics,Business Management,Year 12,Final Exam,Post Exam Report,2024,,VCEBMER,VCEBMERGC,General Comments,,This has ensured that no student lost a mark through this process and no student was disadvantaged as a result of this process.,,16
