to establish and maintain its reputation for offering high-quality rock-climbing experiences in a safe
environment. For the past year, the business has relied on employees with limited experience in the
climbing industry.
During December 2023, three negative reviews of the business appeared online.

Mia Tarian believes that there is a relationship between the three reviews and the number of website :3""

Key ----- Number of website hits = Market share
The market share for this business is based on the number of sales relative to other rock-climbing
centres in the city.
Mia held a meeting and told staff that the following decisions had been made:
All staff must attend training in the correct use of the rock-climbing equipment. The training will be
held on three consecutive Sundays. The centre wil be closed to make this training possible.
Afirst-aid room wil be created on the ground floor and a trained first-aid provider will be employed
during busy periods. The first-aid room will replace the existing staffroom.
Equipment that is rarely used wil be returned to its local suppliers. The business will purchase more
of the high-demand equipment from overseas, rather than from its regular local suppliers.",,4
