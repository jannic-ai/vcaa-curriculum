Addition (sum),"Addition is one of the basic operations of arithmetic and algebra and involves the combination of 2 or more quantities using the [FORMULA] operator. Simple examples could include [FORMULA] or . The inverse operation of addition is subtraction.

Addition may be defined more formally depending on the context. For example:

  • for natural numbers, addition may be defined in terms of counting

addition of real numbers may be modelled using lengths of joined, distinct line segments on a number line

for sets, if [FORMULA] represents the number of elements of a set , and sets [FORMULA] and [FORMULA] are disjoint sets (that is, they have no elements in common), then:

Adjacent,"The term adjacent has several meanings depending on the mathematical context. For example, in a graph (network), 2 vertices (nodes) are adjacent if they are joined by an edge. In geometry, 2 lines are adjacent if they meet at a common vertex and 2 faces in a shape are said to be adjacent if they meet at a common edge. Two fractions are adjacent if the difference between these 2 fractions is a fraction with a unit numerator (a numerator of one): for example, and [FORMULA] are adjacent since [FORMULA] .

Alternate angle,"Consider a transversal (line) intersecting a pair of lines (which may or may not be parallel). Angles that are formed at the intersection of these lines with the transversal, within the two lines, and on opposite sides of the transversal, are called alternate angles.

An example of 2 alternate angles are the angles [FORMULA] and [FORMULA] in the following diagram.

If the pair of lines intersected by the transversal are parallel, then the pair of alternate angles will both be the same size. Conversely, if the 2 alternate angles are the same size, then the 2 lines that are intersected by the transversal are parallel. The angles [FORMULA] and [FORMULA] (where [FORMULA] ) in the diagram below, demonstrate this property.

See also: angle, transversal, parallel",angle; transversal; parallel,,Mathematics
Angle,"An angle is the figure formed by 2 rays sharing a common endpoint, called the vertex of the angle. An angle is typically indicated using an arc and labelled with a letter. Letters used are commonly either Roman, such as [FORMULA] or Greek, such as [FORMULA] (alpha), [FORMULA] (beta), (gamma) and [FORMULA] (theta).

If the vertex point is labelled as well as a point on each of the rays, these can also be used to indicate an angle. For example, the angle AOB, with vertex O, is written ∠AOB and is shown in the diagram below:

Imagine that the ray OB is rotated about the point O until it lies along OA. The amount of turning is called a measure of the angle AOB.

There are 3 common measures of angle:

fraction of a full turn (where one full turn or revolution is 360 degrees or 2π radian)

degree

radian.

Angles are also classified according to their angle measure. An angle with size α is:

acute if 0° < α < 90°

a right angle if α = 90°

obtuse if 90° < α < 180°

a straight angle if α = 180°

reflex if 180° < α < 360°

a revolution (full rotation) if α = 360°.

Possible diagrammatic representations of each type are in the table below.

Approximate/approximation,"To approximate, or make/use an approximation, is to obtain or state a value to a particular accuracy. For example, the fraction   provides an approximate value for the irrational real number . Rounded correct to 4 decimal places,  has the value 3.1429, while [FORMULA] has the value 3.1416. These values are themselves decimal approximations to  and [FORMULA] respectively because they have been rounded.

Approximation may be used in a range of mathematical contexts. For example, in geometry, while it is not possible to trisect any angle exactly using only a compass and ruler, it is possible to approximate such a trisection with reasonable accuracy.

Associative,"An operation is associative if the result of applying the operation to any 3 elements of an expression is the same regardless of which pair of elements (without changing their order) is combined first.

Addition and multiplication are associative on the set of natural numbers, for example:

4 + (7 + 5) = 4 + 12 = 16 and (4 + 7) + 5 = 11 + 5 = 16

2 × (3 × 4) = 2 × 12 = 24 and (2 × 3) × 4 = 6 × 4 = 24

Subtraction and division are not associative on the set of natural numbers. For example:

10 − (4 − 2) = 10 − 2 = 8 but (10 − 4) − 2 = 6 − 2 = 4

24 ÷ (12 ÷ 2) = 24 ÷ 6 = 4 but (24 ÷ 12) ÷ 2 = 2 ÷ 2 = 1

Box-and-whisker plot,"A box-and-whisker plot is a graphical display of a five-number summary (the minimum value, the lower quartile Q1, the median, the upper quartile Q3 and the maximum value).

In a box-and-whisker plot, the ‘box’ covers the interquartile range (IQR = Q3 – Q1), with ‘whiskers’ reaching out from each end of the box to indicate maximum and minimum values in the data set (formally, any data values a distance greater than 1.5 × IQR from the median are represented as individual data points). A vertical line in the box is used to indicate the location of the median.

Cartesian coordinate system,"The position of any point in the Cartesian plane can be represented by an ordered pair of numbers . These ordered pairs are called the coordinates of the point. This is called the Cartesian coordinate system.

The point with coordinates (4, 2) has been plotted on the Cartesian plane shown. The coordinates of the origin are (0, 0).

The Cartesian plane is divided into 4 regions, called quadrants, by the axes and origin of the coordinate system:

Categorical variable,"A categorical variable takes values from sets that are not numerical.

For example, blood group is a categorical variable; its values are A, B, AB or O. So too is construction type of a house; its values might be brick, concrete, timber or steel.

Categories may have numerical labels too: for example, for the variable postcode the category labels would be numbers such as 3787, 5623, 2016, etc., but these labels have no numerical significance. It makes no sense, for example, to use these numerical labels to calculate the average postcode in Australia.

Circle,"A circle is the set of all points in the plane that are a fixed distance (the radius) from a given point (the centre of the circle).  Sometimes ‘circle’ is used to refer to the closed curve, as in the circumference of a circle. At other times, it is used to refer to the entire shape: that is, the region including both the boundary and its interior.

A circle with centre O and radius OA of length r is shown in the following diagram.

A circle can be constructed with a compass or dynamic geometry software, given the centre and radius of the circle, or 3 points that the circle passes through.

See also: chord, diameter, radius",chord; diameter; radius,circle_1.png,Mathematics
Circumference,"The circumference of a circle is also used to refer to the measure of its perimeter. If the diameter or the radius of a circle is known, then its circumference is calculated as:

circumference =   diameter = 2    radius

For example, using   3.14, the circumference of a backyard swimming pool with a 4-metre diameter is approximately 12.56 metres.

For a rough underestimate, the value of  can be taken to be approximately 3. In this case the corresponding rough estimate for the circumference of the pool would be 3  4 = 12 metres.

Closure,"The result of carrying out an operation on an element of a set, or elements of a set, is also an element of that set. This is called closure.

For example, multiplication is closed on the set of natural numbers, because the result of multiplying any pair of natural numbers is also a natural number. Division is not closed on natural numbers, since 9 and 2 are both natural numbers but the result of dividing 9 by 2 is not a natural number. This is because , and [FORMULA] is a decimal fraction, not a natural number.",,,Mathematics

Co-interior angle,"Consider a transversal (line) intersecting a pair of lines (which may or may not be parallel). Angles that are formed at the intersection of these lines with the transversal, within the 2 lines, and on the same side of the transversal, are called co-interior (allied) angles.

An example of 2 co-interior angles are the angles [FORMULA] and [FORMULA] shown in the following diagram:

Note that the angles [FORMULA] and [FORMULA] would also be co-interior angles, but not the angles [FORMULA] and [FORMULA] because they are on different sides of the transversal. The angles [FORMULA] and [FORMULA] would, however, be alternate angles.

If the pair of lines intersected by the transversal are parallel, then the sum of the angle measures of the 2 co-interior angles is 180. Conversely, if the sum of the angle measures of the two co-interior angles is 180, then the 2 lines intersected by the transversal are parallel. For example, in the diagram below, angle .

Commutative,"An operation is commutative if the result of applying the operation to any 2 elements of a set is the same, regardless of the order of the elements. Addition and multiplication are commutative on the set of natural numbers. For example:

6 + 12 = 12 + 6 = 18 and 6 × 12 = 12 × 6 = 72

However, subtraction and division are not commutative. For example:

6 − 12 = − 6 but 12 − 6 = 6 and 6 ÷ 12 = [FORMULA]  but 12 ÷ 6 = 2.

If the universal set in a particular situation is taken to be the set of numbers {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}, then the complement to [FORMULA] = {4, 5, 6} is the set {1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10}. The complement of [FORMULA] is written as , or . So here we could write{1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10}.

Composite number,"A non-zero natural number that has a factor other than 1 and itself is a composite number. Using sets, a non-zero natural number that has more than 2 distinct elements in its factor set is a composite number.

For example, 8 is a composite number as it has 4 distinct elements in its factor set: {1, 2, 4, 8}. The number 2 is not a composite number since it has only 2 distinct elements in its factor set: {1, 2}. With the exception of 1, which has only one distinct element in its factor set: {1}, all non-zero natural numbers are either composite or prime.

Cone,"A cone is a solid that is formed by taking a circular base and a point not in the plane of this circle (either above or below the circle) called the vertex and joining the vertex to each point on the circumference of the circular base.

A right-cone, or vertical cone, is a cone with its vertex directly above the centre of the circular base. The term ‘cone’ is often used to mean a right-cone.

The height of the cone is the distance from the vertex to the centre of the circular base.

An example of a right-cone is below:

A slant cone is a cone with a vertex not directly above the centre of the circular base, as shown below:

A cone may be said to be open or closed depending on whether the circular end is included. For example, an ice-cream cone would be an example of an open cone.

For example, given a set of attribute blocks, specifying the blocks that are red and square involves 2 attributes ‘red’, ‘square’ that apply to some blocks but not to others. The use of the connective and to specify ‘red’ and ‘square’ required both attributes to apply.",,,Mathematics
Constant,"A constant is a number that has a fixed value in a given context. For example, in the calculation of  for different natural numbers , the number 11 is a constant. In formulas such as , 4 is a constant while  and  are variables.

Undetermined constants are constants without known values. For example, the general linear equation [FORMULA] has 2 such constants: [FORMULA] and . Two or more points that lie on a line could be used to find the values of [FORMULA] and [FORMULA] for the equation that describes the line.

Co-prime,"Two positive integers that have no common factors other than 1 are said to be co-prime. For example, 27 and 32 are co-prime because their factor sets are {1, 3, 9, 27} and {1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32} respectively, with the only common factor being 1.

Correspondence,"Four classes of correspondence may be considered:

One-to-one correspondence: A function between 2 sets where each element in one set (domain) corresponds to exactly one element in the other set (range) and vice versa. Thus, in a ballroom dancing class, there will be a one-to-one correspondence between male and female partners during a given dance.

Many-to-one correspondence: A function between 2 sets where each element in one set (domain) corresponds to exactly one element in the other set (range); however, an element in the range may be mapped onto by more than one element in the domain. For example, each student in a class has exactly one height measure (to the nearest centimetre) at a given instant (so the relation 'the height of' is a function) but it may be the case that 2 students are the same height.

One-to-many correspondence: A relation between 2 sets where each element in one set (domain) corresponds to many elements in the other set (range). An example of such a correspondence could be in retail, where a shopper would have a unique customer ID but could have many purchases (given an order number). There would be many different order numbers that correspond to the same customer ID, and only one customer ID linked to each of these specific purchases. A one-to-many correspondence does not define a function. For example, a one-to-many function with 2 different -values for one -value (such as a circle) will fail the vertical line test to check if a relation is a function.

Many-to-many correspondence: A relation between 2 sets where each element in one set (domain) corresponds to many elements in the other set (range), and each element in the range correspond to many elements in the domain. Examples of this type of correspondence are seen in databases. For example, business A might have many suppliers of goods, and each supplier could have many other clients (including, in this case, business A).

Counting on,"Counting on is a strategy for addition problems with 2 numbers that involves counting on from the larger number by the second number. For example, if adding 6 and 3, a student would begin at 6 and count on 3 numbers by saying ‘7, 8, 9’, so 6 + 3 = 9. This is considered a more efficient strategy than counting the whole collection from 1.

Non-terminating decimals may be recurring; that is, contain a pattern of digits that repeats indefinitely after a certain number of places. For example, , is a recurring decimal, whereas , where the number of 0’s between the 1’s increases indefinitely, is not recurring.

Fraction,"A fraction is a number of the form [FORMULA]  where [FORMULA] is an integer and [FORMULA] is a non-zero integer. [FORMULA] If [FORMULA] and [FORMULA] are both positive integers, a fraction can be modelled by dividing a unit length into [FORMULA] equal parts and collecting [FORMULA] multiples of these parts. For example, [FORMULA]  refers to 3 of 5 equal parts of the whole, taken together.

For the fraction [FORMULA]  is called the numerator and [FORMULA] is called the denominator. The horizontal line separating the numerator from the denominator is called the vinculum. [FORMULA] Sometimes a fraction is written on a single line as / in which case the diagonal line is referred to as a solidus.

A fraction [FORMULA] is said to be a proper fraction if [FORMULA] and an improper fraction otherwise. For example, [FORMULA] is a proper fraction while [FORMULA] is an improper fraction.

A fraction is said to be expressed in simplest form if its numerator and denominator have no common factor other than 1. For example, [FORMULA] is expressed in simplest form (because the highest common factor of 3 and 5 is 1), but [FORMULA]  is not in simplest form, since 3 is a common factor of both 6 and 12, as is 6 (the hcf).

Frequency,"Frequency, or observed frequency, is the number of times that a particular value occurs in a data set. For grouped data, it is the number of observations that lie in that group or class interval.

Relative frequency is given by the ratio [FORMULA] , where [FORMULA] is the frequency of occurrence of a particular data value or group of data values in a data set and [FORMULA] is the number of data values in the data set.

An expected frequency is the number of times that a particular event is expected to occur when a chance experiment is repeated a number of times. If the experiment is repeated [FORMULA] times, and on each of those times the probability that the event occurs is , then the expected frequency of the event is . For example, suppose that a fair coin is tossed 5 times and the number of heads showing recorded. Then the expected frequency of ‘heads’ is 5/2 since . This example shows that the expected frequency is not necessarily an observed frequency, which in this case is one of the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5.

Frequency table,"A frequency table lists the frequency (number of occurrences) of observations in different ranges, called class intervals. The frequency distribution of the heights (in cm) of a sample of 42 people is displayed in the frequency table below:

Notice that the class intervals do not overlap (so the number 160, for example, is only counted in one class, not 2). The data in this frequency table could be represented by a histogram.

A two-way frequency table is commonly used for displaying the two-way frequency distribution that arises when a group of individuals or things are categorised according to 2 criteria.

dependent variable: The variable associated with the range of a relation. For a function  with rule ,  is the dependent variable.

independent variable: The variable associated with the domain of a relation. For a function  with rule ,  is the independent variable.

that is,

This can be shown geometrically in the figure below. The golden ratio is given by the proportion
AC : AB = AB : BC where A and C are the endpoints of a line segment and B is the point on the line segment between A and C such that AC : AB = AB : BC.

It is called the golden ratio as it is believed to represent a proportion of lengths that is aesthetically attractive to the human eye in art and design contexts. It also appears in some patterns in nature. The exact value of [FORMULA] is   [FORMULA] = [FORMULA]  and its approximate value is 1.618 correct to 3 decimal places.

Numerical variable,"Numerical variables are variables whose values are numbers, and for which arithmetic processes such as adding and subtracting, or calculating an average, make sense.

A discrete numerical variable is a numerical variable, each of whose possible values is separated from the next by a definite ‘gap’. Common numerical variables often have the numbers {0, 1, 2, 3…} as possible values. Other examples could include prices measured in dollars and cents, the number of children in a family or the number of days in a month.

Order,"Order is a relation that describes the location of elements in a set with respect to each other. These elements may be totally ordered or partially ordered.

For example, the set of natural numbers is totally ordered by the relation ‘less than or equal to’ since, for any 2 natural numbers [FORMULA] and , exactly one of the following is true: 
, [FORMULA] or . Similarly, the set of students in a class can be totally ordered with respect to their height using the relation ‘less than or equal to’.

However, the set of people at a school fair is only partially ordered by the relation ‘is a parent of’ since there will likely be many pairs of people who are not each other’s parent, such as siblings.",,,Mathematics
Order of operations,"The order of operations is a set of conventions for evaluating arithmetic expressions that involve several operations. In general brackets (parentheses) can be used to provide priority, otherwise the order of operations from left to right is exponents (powers, indices), then multiplication/division then addition/subtraction. For example, in , the division is performed first and the expression becomes . If the convention is ignored and the operations are performed in order, a different result of 6.5 is obtained.

{ 12, 12, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 14, 14, 14, 24 }, 24 would be considered to be a possible outlier.

As a rule of thumb, a value that is more than 1.5 interquartile ranges less than the lower quartile, or greater than the upper quartile, is a possible outlier.

Parallel,"Two lines are parallel if they have no points of intersection in the plane, and the same gradient (slope) in the coordinate plane. The symbol || is often used to mean one ray or line segment is parallel to another. For example, the 2 lines below are parallel:

For a geometric figure such as the parallelogram shown below, different numbers of arrow heads may be used to denote sets of lines that are parallel. For example, the pair of lines BA and CD are a parallel pair (2 arrowheads on each) while AD and BC are another parallel pair (one arrowhead on each). Note that BA is not parallel to AD, for example.",,parallel_1.png,Mathematics
Parallel box-and-whisker plots,"Parallel box-and-whisker plots are used to visually compare the five-number summaries of 2 or more data sets. The term ‘parallel box-and-whisker plot’ is commonly abbreviated to ‘parallel boxplot’.

For example, a parallel box-and-whisker plot below can be used to compare the five-number summaries for the pulse rates of 19 students before and after gentle exercise.

Note that the box plot for pulse rates after exercise shows the pulse rate of 146 as a possible outlier. This is because the distance of this data point above the upper is more than 1.5 times the interquartile range.

Percentile,"The percentile is the value that corresponds to a cumulative frequency of [FORMULA]  for a sample size.

The first quartile () is the 25th percentile, the second quartile (the median or ) is the 50th percentile, and the third quartile () is the 75th percentile. The maximum value of a data set is the 100th percentile (all other values are less than this).

For example, for a sample of 4 students (), the students heights in cm are found to be 150, 152, 156 and 167. The median value of 154 is the 50th percentile as 50% of the data values (2 values) are smaller than this since [FORMULA]  (.

Polygon,"The word ‘polygon’ literally means ‘many sides’. A polygon is a simple (no lines crossing) closed (all lines need to join to enclose a region) plane figure with sides formed by straight lines. For example, triangles, quadrilateral, pentagons and hexagons are polygons.

Polygons with all sides of equal length, and all angles between adjacent sides equal, are said to be regular polygons. Examples of regular polygons are shown below.

If all sides are not of equal length, and all angles not of equal measure, the polygon is an irregular polygon. Polygons may also be described as concave if they have any interior angles greater than 180° and convex if all interior angles are less than 180°.

The triangle below could be described as an irregular convex polygon. The second shape is an example of an irregular concave polygon (hexagon).

Range (relation),"A relation is a correspondence between 2 sets. When one of the sets is specified as the set of elements to which the correspondence is made, this set is called the co-domain of the relation. The subset of the co-domain to which elements of the domain are actually matched up, is called the range of the relation.

For example, if a correspondence is formed between the students in a class and their favourite colour, the students would be a natural choice for the domain of relation. The range corresponds to the actual set of favourite colours of the students. The co-domain is the set of all possible colours, not just the favourites of the class of students.

Real numbers,"The numbers generally used in mathematics, in scientific work and in everyday life are the real numbers. Real numbers are any of the elements of the infinite set R, which comprises the union of the set of rational numbers with the set of irrational numbers. A rational real number has either a terminating (finite) decimal expansion, such as , or an infinite recurring decimal expansion: for example, 
Some well-known irrational real numbers are the square root of 2 (), pi (), and the golden ratio, phi (). These can be used in exact calculations: for example, [FORMULA]  or [FORMULA]  .

Often rational approximations to irrational real numbers are used in arithmetic calculations, with a suitable accuracy for the purpose of computation: for example, [FORMULA] and [FORMULA] , correct to 3 decimal places.

All real numbers can be expressed using an infinite decimal expansion: for example, the natural number 2 can be written as either: 2 = 1.9999999999… or  2 = 2.0000000000…

The set of real numbers, R, includes the natural numbers, N, integers, Z, rational numbers, Q and irrational numbers, Q′ as proper subsets, illustrated in the Venn diagram below.

The real numbers are often represented using the infinite set of points on a continuous geometric line. This representation is referred to as the real number line. A one-to-one correspondence between the set of real numbers and the infinite set of points on the line is taken as given, with a specific point, O (the origin) selected to correspond to zero. A point X to the right of O is taken to correspond to the positive real number x, where the magnitude of x measures the length of the line segment OX.

Recursion,"Recursion is the process of carrying out the current step of a process using the results of the previous step (or steps) of the same process. For example, the sequence of numbers

{3, 6, 12, 24, … } can be described using recursion as ‘start at 3 and make the next term in the sequence twice the previous term in the sequence’.

Students often intuitively define sequences using recursion. Skip-counting by ‘counting by fives starting from 12’ is an example of a recursive process.

Reflection,"A reflection is a transformation of the plane where each point in the plane is reflected in a given mirror line. To reflect the point A in an axis of reflection, a line has been drawn at right angles to the axis of reflection and the point A′ is marked at the same distance from the axis of reflection as A, but on the other side.

The point A′ is called the reflection image of A. A reflection, then, is a transformation that moves each point to its reflection image. The points on the mirror line are invariant (unchanged) under this transformation.

Related denominators,"Denominators are related when one is a multiple of the other. For example, the fractions [FORMULA]  and [FORMULA]  have related denominators because 9 is a multiple of 3.

Fractions with related denominators are often more easily added and subtracted than fractions with unrelated denominators. For example, to add [FORMULA]  and [FORMULA] , we know the equivalent fraction of [FORMULA]  is [FORMULA]  , so we can then compute .

Relation,"A relation is a correspondence (map) between the elements of 2 sets. For example, the relation ‘has the favourite colour’ between the set of students in a class (the domain of the relation) and the set of colours (the co-domain of the relation).

Remainder,"If [FORMULA] and [FORMULA] are 2 natural numbers with [FORMULA] greater than , such that [FORMULA] where [FORMULA] and are also natural numbers, then [FORMULA] is said to be the remainder of [FORMULA] on division by . For example, if [FORMULA] = 29 and [FORMULA] = 6, then [FORMULA] = 4 × [FORMULA] + 5, so the remainder of 29 on division by 6 is 5.

More simply, a remainder is the amount left over when one number or algebraic quantity [FORMULA] is divided by another . If [FORMULA] is divisible by [FORMULA] then the remainder is 0. For example, 66 is divisible by 11 because the remainder is 0 (since ). However, when 68 is divided by 11, the remainder is 2, because 68 can be expressed as​ . So, 68 is not divisible by 11.

Rotation,"A rotation is a transformation where each point in the plane is rotated through a given angle about a fixed point (the point of rotation). A rotation turns a figure about a fixed point, called the centre of rotation.

A rotation is specified by:

the centre of rotation O

the angle of rotation

the direction of rotation (clockwise or anticlockwise).

In the first diagram below, the point A is rotated through 120o clockwise about O. In the second diagram, it is rotated through 60° anticlockwise about O.

Rounding,"Rounding is the process for approximating a value that lies between 2 known values by one of these values. In particular, when a measure lies between 2 of the smallest marks on a scale, it is rounded to the nearest value represented by either one of these marks.

Rounding is used to specify a number correct to a given accuracy. With measurements this often means rounding a decimal number.

The decimal expansion of a real number is rounded when it is approximated by a terminating decimal that has a given number of decimal digits to the right of the decimal point.

Rounding to [FORMULA] decimal places is achieved by removing all decimal digits beyond (to the right of) the [FORMULA] digit to the right of the decimal place and adjusting the remaining digits where necessary.

If the first digit removed (the [FORMULA] digit) is less than 5 the preceding digit is not changed. For example, [FORMULA] becomes [FORMULA] when rounded to 3 decimal places.

If the first digit removed is greater than 5, or 5 and some succeeding digit is non-zero, the preceding digit is increased by 1. For example, [FORMULA] becomes [FORMULA] when rounded to 5 decimal places.

Rounding of decimals may also be achieved by rounding to the place value (for example, tenths, hundredths). 16.29 rounded to the nearest tenth of a unit is 16.3, rounded to the nearest unit is 16, rounded to the nearest 5 is 15, and rounded to the nearest ten is 20. The decimal number 57.139 rounded to the nearest hundredth is 57.14 and rounded to the nearest tenth is 57.1. However, 57.199 rounded to the nearest hundredth is 57.200.

Some general principles for rounding are:

if the last digit is a 1, 2, 3 or 4 then the previous digit is left unchanged and the number is said to be rounded down; for example, 296.2 rounded to the nearest integer is rounded down to 296

if the last digit is a 6, 7, 8 or 9 then the previous digit is increased by 1 and the number is said to be rounded up; for example, 296.8 rounded to the nearest integer is rounded up to 297

if the last digit is a 5 then the previous digit can be randomly rounded up or down, especially where several measurements are taken. This avoids cumulative error that would arise from either always rounding up or always rounding down; for example, 296.5 would be randomly rounded to either 296 or 297

if rounding to a given accuracy has a cumulative effect, zeroes should be used to indicate the accuracy; for example, 299.97 rounded to the nearest tenth is 300.0.

It should be noted that several different conventions for rounding a last digit of 5 can be found in the literature, and these relate to different contexts for number computation. In school mathematics, last digits 1, 2, 3 and 4 ‘round down’, and last digits 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 ‘round up’.",,,Mathematics

Variable,"A variable is a term used to designate an arbitrary element of a set. For example, if [FORMULA] is any natural number, then [FORMULA] is an odd natural number. The terms [FORMULA] and [FORMULA] are called variables. The rules of functions are often specified using variables for example, the function that takes a number, squares it then subtracts 3, can be specified in terms of the variables [FORMULA] and [FORMULA] as .

When investigating relationships in bivariate data, the explanatory variable is the variable that may explain or cause a difference in the response variable. For example, when investigating the relationship between the temperature of a loaf of bread and the time it has spent in a hot oven, temperature is the response variable and time is the explanatory variable.

With numerical bivariate data, it is common to attempt to model such relationships with a mathematic equation and to call the response variable the dependent variable and the explanatory variable the independent variable. When graphing numerical data, the convention is to display the response (dependent) variable on the vertical axis and the explanatory (independent) variable on the horizontal axis. When there is no clear causal link between the events, the classification of the variables as either the dependent or independent variable is quite arbitrary.

An arbitrary (free) variable is variable whose scope is not limited by a logical quantifier. Free variables frequently are used in proofs to represent an arbitrary element of a set.

Venn diagram,"A Venn diagram is a graphical representation, using several typically overlapping closed curves, such as circles, of the relationship between elements of sets in relation to properties or attributes. They are drawn with respect to some specified universal set.

For example, consider the universal set of all students at a school, the set of girl students, and the set of students with brown hair. All students can be represented on a Venn diagram as shown below.

Venn diagrams are normally used where 2 or 3 sets are involved. In probability problems, Venn diagrams are used to represents subsets of a sample space for events.

Zero,"The word zero comes from the Arabic word sifr, or cipher in English, which means a secret or disguised writing, or a symbol for a vacant place. The numeral 0 is used to denote the number zero.

As a result, zero plays 2 important roles in mathematics: as a number and as an empty place holder digit in the decimal expansion of numbers. For example, the digit 0 in the number 2057 indicates ‘no hundreds’ in the place value expansion of the number two thousand and fifty-seven or equivalently .

For sets, zero specifies the number of elements in an empty set (none). Although closely related, the number zero, 0, is not the same as the empty set, { }, which is sometimes represented by the special symbol, Ø to distinguish the set from the number. The empty set is a collection that has no elements. Zero indicates the number of elements in this set which is none.

Zero also corresponds to the origin on the real number line:

The point of intersection of the vertical and horizontal axes of the Cartesian coordinate system is also called the origin and designated by the letter O. This origin is specified by the coordinates (0, 0) and plays an important role in work on graphs of functions and other relations.

Zero has several important number properties.

For any real number , it is the case that [FORMULA] (zero is the identity element for addition) and that .

Zero is not a factor of any real number other than itself, and any real number is a factor of zero.

The arithmetic operation of division by zero is not well defined, and results in an error statement when this computation is attempted using technology.

The expression [FORMULA] is a fraction representation of the integer zero, as are the equivalent fractions [FORMULA]  The expression [FORMULA]  is said to be indeterminate, since an assumption that , where [FORMULA] is some real number, would imply 
, which is true for any real number. The expression [FORMULA]  is said to be inconsistent or undefined, since an assumption that [FORMULA] where [FORMULA] is some real number, would imply , which is false for all real numbers.
