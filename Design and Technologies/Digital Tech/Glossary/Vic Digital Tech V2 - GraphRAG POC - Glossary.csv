The use of keywords (e.g. START, END, IF, UNTIL) provides a syntax similar to that of a programming language to assist with identifying logical steps necessary to properly describe the algorithm. Here is a structured English description of a person's decision about how to get to a destination based on the weather and the distance from their current location to their destination. START IF it is raining outside THEN Catch the bus ELSE IF it is less than 2 km to the destination THEN Walk ELSE IF it is less than 10 km to the destination THEN Ride a bicycle ELSE Catch the bus ENDIF ENDIF END The structured English description can easily be translated into code using a programming language and it accurately captures the logical elements that must be followed to answer the question."

Technologies,Digital Technologies,Types of data,"General categories of data that can be transmitted between digital systems, such as text (e.g. text messages), numeric (e.g. sporting results), sound (e.g. streamed music) and images (e.g. photos)."
Technologies,Digital Technologies,Unicode,"An encoding system used to represent characters expressed in most of the world's writing systems. Character representations consist of the letter U followed by a plus sign and a hexadecimal number. For example, the English upper-case letter E is represented by the code U+0045, whereas the French upper-case letter Ê (with a circumflex) is represented by the code U+00CA."
Technologies,Digital Technologies,Uniform Resource Locator (URL),A reference to an address of a resource on the internet. This is used to locate a file on the internet. The URL consists of the protocol and the domain name or IP address.
Technologies,Digital Technologies,Universal Serial Bus (USB),"An industry standard that specifies the protocols for sharing data between devices, connecting and powering devices. Devices include PCs and laptops; peripherals such as keyboards, headsets and mouses; and storage devices such as flash drives and external hard drives."

Technologies,Digital Technologies,User experience,"Aspects (e.g. navigation design, visual design, expertise of user and ergonomics) that affect how a user interacts with digital systems."
Technologies,Digital Technologies,User interface,"The characteristics of the boundary between users and a digital system**,** or the manner in which users interact with digital system components (hardware and software). For software, this usually comprises fields for text and number entry, mouse pointers, buttons and other graphical elements. For hardware, switches, dials and LEDs provide information about the interactions between a user and machine."
Technologies,Digital Technologies,Validate,"Check that input data, such as its accuracy, consistency, completeness and bias, is reasonable."

Technologies,Digital Technologies,Virtual reality (VR),"A self-contained environment in which a user can immerse themselves in simulated surroundings. A range of sensors such as headsets and gloves are used to assist the user in the simulated environment. There are 3 types of VR: non-immersive, semi-immersive and fully immersive."
Technologies,Digital Technologies,Visual program/programming,"Programming languages or environments in which a program is represented and created visually rather than as text. A common visual metaphor represents statements and control structures as blocks that can be composed to form programs, allowing programming without syntax errors. Examples of visual programming languages are Alice, GameMaker, Kodu, LEGO Mindstorms, MIT App Inventor and Scratch (Build Your Own Blocks and Snap). A visual programming language is not the same as a programming language for creating visualisations or programs with user interfaces (e.g. Processing or Visual Basic)."
